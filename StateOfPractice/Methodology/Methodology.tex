\section{Introduction} \label{SecIntroduction}

Purpose and scope of the document.  \wss{Needs to be filled in.  Should
	reference the overall research proposal, and the ``state of the practice''
	exercise in particular.}

\section{Overview of Steps in Assessing Quality of the Domain Software}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify domain.  (Provide criteria on a candidate domain.)
\item 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Identify Candidate Software}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Must be open source.
	\item Must have GitHub repository.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Domain Analysis} \label{SecDomainAnalysis}

Commonality analysis.  Follow as for mesh generator (likely with less detail).

Commonality analysis document Steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Introduction
	\item Overview of Domain
	\item Add Commonalities - Split into simulation, input, output, and nonfunctional requirements
	\item Add Variabilites - Split into simulation, input, output, system constraints, and nonfunctional requirements
	\item Add Parameters of Variation - Split into simulation, input, output, system constraints, and nonfunctional requirements
	\item Add Terminology, Definitions, Acronyms
\end{enumerate}


Commonality analysis for Lattice Boltzmann Solvers can be found \href{run:../Peter-Notes/Commonality-Analysis-LB-Systems.pdf}{here}.

\section{Empirical Measures}

\subsection{Raw Data}
Measures that can be extracted from on-line repos.

\ad{Still at brainstorm stage.}
\begin{itemize}
\item number of contributors
\item number of watches
\item number of stars
\item number of forks
\item number of clones
\item number of commits
\item number of total/code/document files
\item lines of total/logical/comment code
\item lines/pages of documents (can pdf be extracted?)
\item number of total/open/closed/merged pull requests
\item number of total/open/closed issues
\item number of total/open/closed issues with assignees
\end{itemize}

Instead of only focus on the current status of the above numbers, we may find
the time history of them to be more valuable. For example, the number of
contributors over time, the number of lines of code over time, the number of
open issues over time, etc.

\subsection{Processed Data}
Metrics that can be calculated from the raw data.

\ad{Still at brainstorm stage.}
\begin{itemize}
\item percentage of total/open/closed issues with assignees -
Visibility/Transparency
\item lines of new code produced per person-month - Productivity
\item lines/pages of new documents produced per person-month - Productivity
\item number of issues closed per person-month - Productivity
\item percentage of comment lines in the code - maintainability \ad{Not Ao's
qualities}
\end{itemize}

In the above calculations, a month can be determined to be 30 days.

\subsection{Tool Tests}
\ad{This section is currently a note of unorganized contents. Most parts will beremoved or relocated.}

\ad{This citation needs to be deleted later. It's here because my compiler
doesn't work with 0 citations}
\cite{Emms2019}

Most tests were done targeting to the repo of 3D Slicer
\href{https://github.com/tomgi/git_stats}{GitHub repo}

\subsubsection{git-stats}
\href{https://github.com/tomgi/git_stats}{GitHub repo}

Test results:
\href{http://git-stats-slicer.ao9.io/}{http://git-stats-slicer.ao9.io/} the
results are output as webpages, so I hosted for you to check. Data can be
downloaded as spreadsheets.

\subsubsection{git-of-theseus}
\href{https://github.com/erikbern/git-of-theseus}{GitHub repo}

Test results: It took about 100 minutes for one repo on a 8 core 16G ram Linux
machine. It only outputs graphs.

\subsubsection{hercules}
\href{https://github.com/src-d/hercules}{GitHub repo}

Test results: this one seems to be promising, but the installation is
complicated with various errors.

\subsubsection{git-repo-analysis}
\href{https://github.com/larsxschneider/git-repo-analysis}{GitHub repo}

\subsubsection{HubListener}
\href{https://github.com/pjmc-oliveira/HubListener}{GitHub repo}

The data that HubListener can extract.

Raw:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of Files
\item Number of Lines
\item Number of Logical Lines
\item Number of Comments
\end{itemize}

Cyclomatic:
\href{https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cyclomatic-complexity/}{Intro}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cyclomatic Complexity
\end{itemize}
 
Halstead:
\href{https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-halsteads-software-metrics/}{Intro}
\begin{itemize}
\item Halstead Effort
\item Halstead Bugs
\item Halstead Length
\item Halstead Difficulty
\item Halstead Time
\item Halstead Vocabulary
\item Halstead Volume
\end{itemize}

Test results: HubListener works well on the repo of itself, but it did not work
well on some other repos.

\subsubsection{gitinspector}
\href{https://github.com/ejwa/gitinspector}{GitHub repo}

Test results: it doesn't work well. Instead of creating output results, it
prints the results directly in the console.

\section{User Experiments}
\subsection{Usability Experiment}
Steps:
\begin {enumerate}
\item Write research questions
\item Prepare logistic details(location, time table, recording setup, moderators etc)
\item Prepare survey questions
\item Select a list of projects
\item Design the tasks for the study subjects to perform (tasks can be defined based on user category, at least one task to modify the software)
\item Select participants
\item Conduct usability session
\item Survey the study subject to collect pre-experiment data
\item Perform tasks
\item Observe the study subjects (take notes, record sessions, watch out for body language and verbal cues)
\item Survey the study subjects to collect final feedback
\item Prepare experiment report
\item Perform pairwise comparison analysis
\item Prepare analysis report
\end {enumerate}

\subsection{Empirical Measures}
 \begin {enumerate}
 \item Qualitative/Quantitative
 \item Pairwise Comparison methodology needs to be described
 \item Measure time to complete a task and compare actual with expected time of completion
 \item From a list of given tasks, measure how many tasks were completed correctly
\end {enumerate}

\subsection{Tools}
\begin {enumerate} 
\item Downloaded OBS to record experiment sessions
\end {enumerate}
\subsection{To do}
\begin {enumerate}
 \item Detail plan
 \item Describe Pairwise methodology
 \item Define tasks
 \item prepare survey questions
 \end {enumerate}

\section{Analytic Hierarchy Process}
