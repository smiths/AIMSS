The tools for Empirical Measures:
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/tomgi/git_stats}{git\_stats}
\item \href{https://github.com/boyter/scc}{scc}
\end{itemize}

\ad{For now it only contains raw metrics. We'll have to consider how to use them to calculate more meaningful metrics.}

\begin{longtable}{p{16cm}}
  \caption{Grading Template}   \label{table:TemplateFull}\\
  \toprule
  \textbf{Raw Metrics} (Measured via git\_stats)\\
  \midrule
  Number of text-based files. (number)\\
  Number of binary files. (number)\\
  Number of total lines in text-based files. (number)\\
  Number of total lines added to text-based files. (number)\\
  Number of total lines deleted from text-based files. (number)\\
  Number of total commits. (number)\\
Numbers of commits by year in the last 5 years. (Count from as early as possible
if the project is younger than 5 years.) (list of numbers)\\
  Numbers of commits by month in the last 12 months. (list of numbers)\\
  
  \midrule
  \textbf{Raw Metrics} (Measured via scc)\\
  \midrule
  Number of text-based files. (number)\\
  Number of total lines in text-based files. (number)\\
  Number of code lines in text-based files. (number)\\
  Number of comment lines in text-based files. (number)\\
  Number of blank lines in text-based files. (number)\\

  \midrule
  \textbf{Raw Metrics} (Measured via GitHub API)\\
  \midrule
Numbers of commits, added lines, and deleted lines by author by week.
(2-dimensional list of numbers) \ad{I know we're not likely to measure this.
Just a note that we can get this data. It's only available for GitHub repos, and
I have to test tools for parsing JSON data (e.g. to Excel table).}\\
