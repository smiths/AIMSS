00:00:02 Interviewer 

Sure, now perhaps we can start our questions so there are twenty of them. I'm going to start from the first question. 

00:00:12 Interviewer 

Perhaps you 2 can give us a short introduction about yourself, such as your current position, title, and degrees. 

00:00:21 Developer1 

Uh, I'm joggle, uh, I have a master degree in computer. 

00:00:27 Developer1 

Uh, I'm working with Ingersoll since, uh, twenty 08, uh. 

00:00:36 Developer1 

 

00:00:37 Developer1 

My main interests are computer graphics, medical imaging. 

00:00:43 Developer1 

Uh, artificial intelligence? Uh, anything like that. 

00:00:48 Developer1 

 

00:00:51 Developer1 

I have, uh, also I. 

00:00:54 Developer2 

 

00:00:57 Developer1 

Yeah, I think it. It's that. 

00:00:59 Interviewer 

Yeah, I think that's good enough. 

00:01:01 Developer2 

I I am follow I have the bachelor and master in computer science and I started on the project in 2007 as intern. 

00:01:15 

 

00:01:16 Developer2 

And, uh. 

00:01:18 Developer2 

 

00:01:19 Developer2 

It was completed a 414 here seeing project in values and and mine tourist shares is imaging processing artificial intelligence. 

00:01:35 Developer2 

An intelligent search show and computer graphics like key. 

00:01:40 Developer2 

 

00:01:40 Developer1 

OK yeah we have more two people working within vessels, but they are, uh, not they don't work with us directly. 

00:01:51 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:01:51 Developer1 

They have a. They have a uh, interesting in some parting values and they work with that part. OK, so we we are the main. 

00:01:59 Interviewer 

OK, sounds good. 

00:02:02 Developer1 

Uh, developers of values we we have then, but we have a uh, to maintain values in, you know. 

00:02:02 Developer2 

It's blockers. 

00:02:11 Developer1 

Everything they just, uh, help us with this. That part OK? 

00:02:17 Interviewer 

So which means you two are the core developers. There are more in the team. 

00:02:20 Developer2 

 

00:02:22 Developer2 

And and George George George Silva is the hedge of he. He started the project in early 2000 years. 

00:02:36 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:02:37 Developer2 

OK, and but she now it's ahead of. It's only minor change. 

00:02:38 Developer2 

 

00:02:38 Developer2 

 

00:02:43 

 

00:02:47 Interviewer 

 

00:02:48 Developer2 

And so far you understand the the software, the history of software and. 

00:02:48 Developer2 

And so far you understand the the software, the history of software. 

00:02:55 Developer2 

This the project was borning early two 2000 years and George Head off laboratory both to 3D printer. At the time he wanted to help public hospitals by providing. 

00:03:01 Interviewer 

 

00:03:08 

 

00:03:14 Developer2 

3D printed anatomical models for Brazilian public ostos. 

00:03:21 Developer2 

OK, for for for 3D printed anatomical models, for public hospitals, Brazilian public hospitals. But she at the time. 

00:03:23 Interviewer 

 

00:03:32 Developer2 

 

00:03:33 Developer2 

The software had over did the tomography for for SL or much is. 

00:03:41 Interviewer 

 

00:03:43 Developer2 

First pensive. 

00:03:45 Developer2 

And so each. 

00:03:47 Developer2 

To develop, and today you are here. In the third version. 

00:03:55 Developer1 

Yeah we we started because we don't have access to any other software and they they won't, uh. 

00:04:02 Developer1 

Uh, disponible were very expensive, you know, and so we had. We started the developing Internet. No, not me and the all the people in that time at that time. 

00:04:16 Interviewer 

Yeah, I did see that you did a very good job. 

00:04:18 Developer2 

See now. 

00:04:22 Developer2 

Serves a public hospitals and singeing 3D printer models for surgery planning. 

00:04:28 Developer2 

 

00:04:28 Developer2 

 

00:04:32 Developer2 

And marketing 5003 D models have already been shipped for for hospitals. 

00:04:32 Developer2 

 

00:04:32 Developer2 

 

00:04:41 Interviewer 

 

00:04:42 Developer2 

 

00:04:43 Interviewer 

Nice, OK, I'm going to continue my questions, but you you are very welcome to just add the information you want to like describe to me. 

00:04:48 Developer1 

OK. 

00:04:55 Interviewer 

Yeah, so second question is that you told me that you are the core developers in the team, but could be. 

00:05:03 Interviewer 

Could you please give me a little more details about your relationship to the project? Such as do you only develop the the software or? 

00:05:15 Interviewer 

Do you also work as project managers? 

00:05:20 Interviewer 

Uh, something like that. 

00:05:22 Developer1 

Yeah, we we work with both holes. OK, we are developed and the the software engineers for for the the software. OK, OK because we we are only two we both. 

00:05:23 Developer2 

 

00:05:23 Developer2 

 

00:05:33 Developer2 

Yes, Sir. 

00:05:35 

 

00:05:41 Developer1 

OK, working with uh we like his Paul said we we work in a uh. 

00:05:43 Interviewer 

 

00:05:48 Developer2 

This is. 

00:05:51 Developer1 

Public institution, but, uh, they don't have other. 

00:05:57 Developer1 

Developers there, they they are, uh, we are the only developers there. We, the other people are from other parts of other type of. 

00:06:07 Developer1 

Knowledge means some by all. Biologists, uh mathematicians, physicians. OK so we have to do, uh? 

00:06:13 Interviewer 

Oh, OK. 

00:06:15 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:06:19 Developer1 

More than one rolling in developer of vessels we. 

00:06:25 Developer1 

We manage it. We developed and we fix all the the bugs OK. 

00:06:31 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:06:31 Developer2 

Reporter his sure sure help helping the users. 

00:06:34 Developer1 

 

00:06:38 Developer1 

Even giving lectures. 

00:06:39 Developer2 

Part speech off interview. 

00:06:44 Developer1 

We have we do lectures about in values too. Uh, it's. 

00:06:49 Developer1 

It's because we are just the two we chew now. OK doing the work. 

00:06:54 Interviewer 

Yeah so. 

00:06:56 Interviewer 

OK, so you you are the developers but they are other Staffs. They are like medical workers, mathematicians. OK, gotcha, right? 

00:07:04 Interviewer 

 

00:07:04 Interviewer 

 

00:07:08 Developer1 

It's yours too, yeah, uh. 

00:07:08 Developer2 

 

00:07:13 Interviewer 

Could you please both? Uh, tell me again how many years you have been working into this project? I think Paul told me that you started from 2007. Yeah, OK? 

00:07:25 Developer2 

Yes, now for 14 years. 

00:07:27 Developer1 

 

00:07:30 Interviewer 

******* years, yeah? 

00:07:31 Developer1 

I started that at 2008, one year after. 

00:07:34 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:07:37 Interviewer 

Yeah, sounds good. 

00:07:39 Interviewer 

 

00:07:40 Interviewer 

So how? 

00:07:43 Interviewer 

Do you have any idea about how large is the group? I understand that you are the core developers, but if we include every people every person working on this project, roughly how many people working on this project? 

00:07:58 

 

00:08:00 Developer1 

Just I mean, it's, uh. 

00:08:03 Developer1 

At at GitHub we have, uh. 

00:08:07 

Right? 

00:08:10 Developer1 

Nine people, but, uh, some of them just contributed with one community or. 

00:08:16 Interviewer 

Yeah yeah, yeah. 

00:08:17 Developer1 

Yeah, but uh, we are, uh, more for people today but but there there was a girl who started to work with us after the starch. Also in values, but he's working outside and now he is not working with us in vessels OK? 

00:08:30 Interviewer 

 

00:08:38 Interviewer 

OK, he said, uh. 

00:08:40 Developer2 

Yeah, about about five or six people. 

00:08:40 Interviewer 

Go ahead. 

00:08:46 Interviewer 

So core developers in total? How about how about our other people working on other functions such as working in medical imaging, working in medical areas, or we're working in math? 

00:09:05 Interviewer 

Areas if we include everyone. 

00:09:09 Developer1 

The the the two other people working first. They are physically physical physics. They they start with. They work with, uh neural part of OK imaging medical imaging. Yeah they they their interest is are is a. 

00:09:16 

 

00:09:21 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:09:21 Interviewer 

 

00:09:29 Developer1 

Neural navigation the the data is to map the images to the real person. After that like the. 

00:09:42 Developer1 

This surgery or some that so the main, uh? 

00:09:48 Developer1 

Area they develop is related to that part with some, uh, a little, uh. 

00:09:51 Interviewer 

 

00:09:57 Developer1 

Uh, more with a. 

00:10:01 Developer1 

 

00:10:02 Developer1 

I don't know where. 

00:10:04 Developer1 

A leader within emerging leader with a mathematical mathematics order with a. 

00:10:09 Interviewer 

Michael mathematics OK. 

00:10:15 Developer1 

Uh, devices. They need you to, uh? 

00:10:18 Developer1 

To uh, communicate with, uh, some, uh? 

00:10:24 Developer1 

 

00:10:24 Developer2 

Tracker is Special special tracker. 

00:10:26 Developer1 

 

00:10:28 Developer1 

Yes, uh. 

00:10:30 Interviewer 

OK, sounds good so. 

00:10:32 Developer1 

It's they don't work with the part of. 

00:10:37 Developer1 

Uh, like tech factory off in Dallas, but they have those, uh, those parts that they work but mainly is with the. 

00:10:37 Interviewer 

 

00:10:47 Developer1 

Uh, neural navigation OK? 

00:10:52 Interviewer 

Yeah, thank you I'm. 

00:10:55 Interviewer 

Just curious, how does the name of Universal News come? How do you name it? Or do you name this software? What does this mean? 

00:11:06 Developer1 

I don't know. 

00:11:08 Developer2 

In in values its derivative from underalls values. The father of modern. 

00:11:11 Developer1 

Ah, OK. 

00:11:17 Interviewer 

 

00:11:18 Developer2 

Underalls values. 

00:11:20 Interviewer 

Oh OK, yeah. 

00:11:21 Developer2 

It's a version version surgical cap draw one atomic sparks. 

00:11:32 Developer2 

And created a book book of illustration on atomic operation in Middle Middle Years. 

00:11:32 

 

00:11:36 Interviewer 

 

00:11:39 Interviewer 

Ah, OK. 

00:11:44 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:11:45 Interviewer 

That's ingerence. 

00:11:45 Developer1 

He is at the same time of of Leonardo da Vinci. 

00:11:50 Developer1 

Were a little. 

00:11:53 Interviewer 

OK yeah thanks. 

00:11:54 Developer1 

 

00:11:56 Interviewer 

OK, my next question. You just mentioned that on GitHub there are some other contributors. Do you have a process for accepting the contributions? For example easier process based on GitHub. 

00:12:16 Interviewer 

If someone maybe submit a PR then you review the PR, decide to accept it or not. 

00:12:26 Developer1 

Yes, we just follow the GitHub process. Uh, pull request. Then we review it and we try to fix all the the problems then. 

00:12:39 Developer1 

Merge it. 

00:12:39 Developer1 

 

00:12:41 Developer1 

 

00:12:44 Developer1 

Yeah, that's it. 

00:12:45 Interviewer 

Yeah yeah, I I like GitHub. I I think GitHub is really easy to use, yeah? 

00:12:49 Developer1 

Yeah, we we. We like it a. 

00:12:52 Interviewer 

Lot yeah, so so was this project started on GitHub from day one. 

00:12:58 Developer1 

No, no we. 

00:12:59 Interviewer 

Ah, OK. 

00:13:00 Developer1 

It's the uh. 

00:13:02 Developer2 

See the first version is CVS internal. It's an internal server by CBS after Cvma, an tool tool, AutoZone Pain 2012, started on GitHub. 

00:13:08 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:13:10 Interviewer 

 

00:13:23 Developer2 

The POC. 

00:13:24 Interviewer 

Yeah so. 

00:13:25 Developer1 

 

00:13:25 Developer1 

Before I get your help, we use the. 

00:13:29 Developer1 

Other sites to to maintain vessels, but that was it wasn't very good, OK? 

00:13:37 Developer1 

And do we use, uh? 

00:13:39 Developer2 

 

00:13:40 Interviewer 

SVN yeah yeah. I I actually in the 30 software list. I studied most projects use gate. Maybe two of them still used mercury, mercury, mercury and subversion. Only two of them the other is gate. 

00:13:55 Developer1 

 

00:13:59 Developer2 

Yeah, yeah. 

00:14:00 Interviewer 

And further ones using gate, most of them are using GitHub. 

00:14:05 Interviewer 

Only a few of them are still using SourceForge and get back it. Or maybe Git lab. So I think the majority is transferring to GitHub slowly gradually. 

00:14:19 Interviewer 

Alright, my next question so. 

00:14:23 Interviewer 

You you give us the the background of vercellese, So what about the other contributors? What is a typical background of a developer? Do you have any idea? 

00:14:37 Developer1 

Uh, some of them are from information technology or are from physics. 

00:14:44 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:14:45 Developer1 

Uh, I don't know, uh. 

00:14:49 Developer1 

They are from. 

00:14:52 Developer1 

 

00:14:53 Developer2 

Nothing matches. 

00:14:53 Developer1 

That Cyrus maybe. Yeah there is a guy from mathematics, but you you only uh? 

00:15:02 Developer1 

Help those with a commit one commit. 

00:15:06 Interviewer 

OK, I I I talked with some people so some medical imaging developers. They are, uh, maybe medical workers, some of them not. 

00:15:19 Interviewer 

All of them maybe a small part of them, so they they developed the software because they have to. 

00:15:26 Interviewer 

Use by themselves, and I assume that this is not the case. Uh? 

00:15:32 Interviewer 

Here you are developers, but you do not use the software directly. 

00:15:34 Developer1 

 

00:15:38 Developer1 

No no. 

00:15:40 Developer1 

OK, uh, but uh. 

00:15:44 Developer1 

We we have a, uh, a closer contact with with physicians with medical workers. 

00:15:48 Interviewer 

OK, yeah. 

00:15:53 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:15:54 Developer1 

And the order knowledge, but don't publish, it's OK. 

00:15:58 Interviewer 

So they just they, they bring their feedbacks to you. 

00:16:02 Interviewer 

Yes, yes, yeah, that sounds good. 

00:16:05 Interviewer 

Uh, do you have? 

00:16:08 Interviewer 

An estimation about the number of users. 

00:16:12 Interviewer 

Do you have any idea? Maybe how many people are using your software? 

00:16:17 Developer1 

Uh, about UH-75 Seventy 4000 users. We know that about because we when the. 

00:16:29 Developer1 

Uh, the user starts in Dallas for the first time. Yeah, uh, we create a configuration file with a random. 

00:16:33 Interviewer 

 

00:16:33 Interviewer 

 

00:16:37 Interviewer 

 

00:16:40 Developer1 

Yeah, every time the that that user starts in the silence it checks if there is a new version and we use that random ID to counter the people working using the silence. But we don't use any. 

00:16:58 Developer1 

We don't, uh, collect any, uh. 

00:17:03 Developer2 

Additional information 

00:17:04 Interviewer 

Privacy is no problem. 

00:17:05 Developer2 

It might seem. 

00:17:07 Developer1 

OK, yes we we just have the information about the version platform. Yeah operational sustain language. We don't have information about the images. The people who are working the name of the users. 

00:17:08 Developer2 

Yeah no, no question. 

00:17:22 Developer1 

Uh, it's just, uh, information to, uh, statistics. 

00:17:28 Developer1 

 

00:17:30 Interviewer 

Yeah, got you, uh. 

00:17:32 Interviewer 

But yeah, I think it will be harder for I I don't know, let me just ask my next question. 

00:17:38 Interviewer 

So what is the typical background of a user? Here are some examples. I know that maybe graduate students or PhD students they use some medical imaging software. 

00:17:53 Interviewer 

Or maybe medical workers or maybe. 

00:17:59 Interviewer 

Some patients they use this software for themselves, so what's the situation for your software? What are the user? 

00:18:08 Developer1 

Health care professionals are like doctors open to logistics, but we have a students. 

00:18:16 Developer1 

 

00:18:17 Developer1 

 

00:18:17 Developer1 

 

00:18:18 Developer1 

Uh, PhD students Masters student resources. 

00:18:24 Developer1 

Return in irens. Uh, people working with animals, uh? 

00:18:30 Developer1 

Even in paleontologists, uh, we have people working with images of dinosaurs. 

00:18:36 Interviewer 

Oh, OK. 

00:18:37 Developer1 

Uh, even Mechanical Engineers. They they have, uh? 

00:18:38 Interviewer 

 

00:18:43 Developer2 

Oh really, by biomechanical. 

00:18:43 Developer1 

OK. 

00:18:45 Interviewer 

OK, that's interesting. 

00:18:47 Developer1 

Well, they they have a tomography images from some engineers devices. They they wanted to to check it. 

00:18:57 Developer2 

OK, OK. 

00:19:00 Interviewer 

It sounds like Cyberpunk 2077, yeah? 

00:19:06 Developer2 

 

00:19:06 Developer2 

 

00:19:06 Developer1 

Yeah, yeah, we we. 

00:19:07 Developer1 

We have a, uh, some user, some uh, patients using it's too like you said, yeah. 

00:19:13 Developer1 

Yeah, there is a guy. 

00:19:13 Developer1 

There is a guy. 

00:19:16 Developer1 

We feel some problems, uh, contact? Contacted us with some problems with we helped it here in with the the user offering design because he wanted to know what it is. 

00:19:25 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:19:32 Developer1 

Happening to him. 

00:19:34 Interviewer 

Yeah, thanks. 

00:19:36 Developer2 

We we we are mapping users from one one second. 

00:19:36 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:19:45 Developer2 

1600 UN countries. 

00:19:49 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:19:51 Interviewer 

 

00:19:53 Interviewer 

OK, I'm going to ask another question if it's about obstacles. Currently, what are the most significant obstacles in your development process? 

00:20:06 Developer1 

Uh, one problem we have is access to medical images. We we have easy access to city images because at city we have the the the the program that all mentioned that we we see the images. 

00:20:11 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:20:26 Interviewer 

 

00:20:27 Developer1 

Uh, fizzy, we do the work in the sense that the three 3D printed the party to the physician or so we have many, many city images there too. 

00:20:41 Developer1 

To test the, see if it it's working, but you bought that types of images like, uh, MRI, watersound. It's more difficult to have a access then to that. Hey, so we have to. 

00:20:45 Developer1 

But do. 

00:20:45 Developer1 

 

00:20:58 Developer1 

A finding. 

00:21:01 Developer1 

Uh, open data set is or with that people we talked, did that work with neuroimaging so it's a little difficult. 

00:21:13 Developer1 

In in the IT sometimes the the images they send it to us are not in DICOM or is in DICOM but not in. 

00:21:24 Developer1 

Add icon. 

00:21:25 Developer2 

It's standard. 

00:21:27 Developer1 

No, don't don't follow the standard icon standard very well, so we have to do some, uh? 

00:21:30 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:21:32 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:21:35 Developer1 

I work around this to work with it. OK that that that's the problem. 

00:21:41 Interviewer 

Yeah, yeah. I also heard this problem from other developers. They told me that to respect the privacy privacy of patients. 

00:21:52 Interviewer 

Uh, it's really hard to get access to these images. 

00:21:56 Developer1 

 

00:21:59 Interviewer 

OK, so my next question is how you will maybe tackle this problem. How might you change your development process to remove or reduce these obstacles? 

00:22:15 Developer1 

Uh, we tried to find the images. 

00:22:18 Developer1 

Open data sets we try to, uh, contact some people. We have a. 

00:22:18 

 

00:22:27 Developer1 

We, we know may have that type of image in there. We try to to have that image, uh? 

00:22:35 Developer1 

Yeah no, no no. I said that because we don't have the we don't want to have access to. 

00:22:42 Developer1 

Privacy, uh, informational. Uh, yeah, sometimes we have to do some, uh? 

00:22:49 Developer1 

Uh, just a minute. 

00:22:54 Developer1 

 

00:22:58 Developer1 

OK, we have to to do some reverse engineering because the format image format is. 

00:23:09 Developer1 

Uh, proprietary the then we have to do some reverse engineering? Uh, it? That's the problem with desire because but some fabricants don't follow the the standard. 

00:23:09 

 

00:23:24 Interviewer 

Yeah, I I I know that to to ensure the to to ensure the maybe. 

00:23:34 Interviewer 

Less bugs, let's say to ensure there will be less bugs of the software. Maybe you need to do a lot of tests. 

00:23:42 Interviewer 

Without enough if without enough samples or images. 

00:23:48 Interviewer 

Are you able to finish all these tests properly? 

00:23:53 Developer1 

Yeah, sometimes we. 

00:23:56 Developer1 

We have to. 

00:24:00 Developer1 

We we don't have access to all type of emails so we have 2 * 2 with uh is we have at that time you know and so. 

00:24:11 Developer1 

It it's not possible to do tests with all type of things. So we we we we we follow some, uh, the majority of the. 

00:24:17 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:24:24 Developer1 

The device is, uh, the yeah cities corners, uh, being budget. 

00:24:33 Interviewer 

The devices, do you mean the medical devices such as produced by Siemens or GE? 

00:24:37 Developer1 

 

00:24:40 Developer1 

Yes, yeah. They main developers, developers know uh, fabricants like GE. 

00:24:41 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:24:48 Developer1 

Seemings uh Phillips 

00:24:53 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:24:54 Interviewer 

So my next question is about documentation. 

00:24:57 Interviewer 

How does documentation fit into your development process? 

00:25:02 Interviewer 

Would improve documentation help with the obstacles you typically face. 

00:25:09 Developer1 

We try to document every part of imbeciles, but, uh? 

00:25:15 Developer1 

We like you know, uh, we are just two people. Sometimes we don't have time to do that, so some parts of imbeciles there is isn't any documentation, but we try to. 

00:25:31 Developer1 

To write the documentation and execute the each method, the function class. 

00:25:39 Developer2 

They they mean. 

00:25:39 Developer1 

But it's not possible, yeah. 

00:25:42 Developer2 

They they mean methods, the main classes. 

00:25:45 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:25:45 Developer2 

Yeah, it's documented for for developers. 

00:25:49 Developer1 

Yeah yeah, but it it's. It helped us a lot because we sometimes we need to to help it. The other developers we feel we we had a good documentation we. 

00:26:06 Developer1 

Wouldn't need you to do that. 

00:26:09 

 

00:26:09 Developer1 

 

00:26:11 Developer1 

Very much no. We 'cause it, uh, with the documentation. The people. 

00:26:16 Developer1 

Try to do by themselves, OK? 

00:26:20 Interviewer 

 

00:26:20 Interviewer 

Definitely I agree myself is a developer. Sometimes when I learn new technologies, I find I found out that good documentation can be really helpful and I also understand that writing documentation is not as fun as writing code. 

00:26:31 Developer1 

 

00:26:37 Interviewer 

 

00:26:38 

 

00:26:38 

 

00:26:40 Interviewer 

OK, next question, uh? 

00:26:43 Interviewer 

So in the past, is there any major obstacle to your development process that has been solved, and how did you solve it? 

00:26:54 Developer1 

Uh, I think start at the start of in values three. We tried it too. 

00:26:58 

 

00:27:01 Developer1 

To not use a lot of memory, remember run because we try to making these islands to people. Use it at desktop. 

00:27:06 Interviewer 

OK, yeah. 

00:27:14 Developer1 

The the simple computers the people have at the house. OK, not the ones they have access to in the university, but the. 

00:27:16 Interviewer 

Yeah, yeah. 

00:27:25 Developer1 

So the simple ones OK. So at the start of it we we had this problem because the the people couldn't, uh, using values with a. 

00:27:39 Developer1 

A lot of images because it took a lot of memory, so we we tried to to fix this problem. Uh, so we we are using now a. 

00:27:45 Interviewer 

 

00:27:45 Interviewer 

Oh, OK. 

00:27:54 Developer1 

Memory memory mapped files in map. We use a loop. I mean map it to do that too because it's it's easier to using the that because it's. 

00:28:08 Developer1 

 

00:28:11 Developer1 

It's more, it's easier than using direct directly from operational system. We have this. 

00:28:18 Developer1 

A very good library in Pi, so we used that part of that to allow us to use member memory mapped files. So this problem is. 

00:28:20 Interviewer 

 

00:28:29 Interviewer 

 

00:28:33 Developer1 

It was fixed because we don't need a lot of memory to keep all the images lies at the memory. 

00:28:42 Interviewer 

 

00:28:43 Interviewer 

Oh that that's a yeah, that's interesting. I'm more familiar with web development than desktop software development. It's it's good. It's always good to learn some new stuff. Thanks. 

00:28:57 Developer1 

Yes, it. It's basically it's like a. 

00:29:01 Developer1 

UH, broadcast memory, but it's not in the memory. It's in the disk. 

00:29:08 Interviewer 

 

00:29:08 Developer1 

But, uh, we use a functionality at operational system, namely a map in a memory map. Yeah, he acts like a memory block, but just the party we are using at the moment is keeping on the memory. 

00:29:28 Developer1 

The other parts are. 

00:29:30 Developer1 

Yeah, in the. 

00:29:31 Developer1 

Just yeah. 

00:29:31 Developer1 

 

00:29:31 Developer1 

Just so we it helped us a lot. 

00:29:35 Interviewer 

 

00:29:36 Interviewer 

I'm curious that did you? Did you compare the performance? 

00:29:40 Interviewer 

So purely use memory, a mixing memory and disk. Is there any difference in the performance? 

00:29:50 Developer1 

There is a little difference because the this is a very optimized part of the every uh operational system. OK, he used a cache and other things to to remove the. 

00:30:09 Interviewer 

 

00:30:09 Developer1 

Uh, uh, the the problem with, uh? 

00:30:10 Interviewer 

Oh yes. 

00:30:15 Developer1 

The time to to to get the the memory in disk, then putting that memory he uses, uh? 

00:30:24 Developer1 

Uh, a lot of, uh, cache, but it's not so much like you we put all the images at the member, OK? 

00:30:30 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:30:30 Interviewer 

 

00:30:31 Interviewer 

Yeah, thanks. My next question is about your software development model. What is your software development model? For example, I know there there are like waterfall model or maybe some teams use a gel. 

00:30:50 Developer1 

Uh, we don't follow a development model very closely, but we from what I know we follow more or less closely. 

00:31:01 Developer1 

To the waterfall development? Uh, because we we have contact with a physicians and doctors don't always. They told us how we needed to touch it. 

00:31:14 Developer1 

Uh, some feature E doing we try to develop it. We talk with the that person, uh, we talking with both of us. Then we try to develop it. It's dying. 

00:31:30 Developer1 

When it's, uh? 

00:31:33 Developer1 

Uh, it's finished. We try to to test it. They send each other to the people to test it, but we have some features we. 

00:31:47 Developer1 

Uh, I was asked by people with or work with us. They work at that part that received images or images from other people from other. 

00:31:57 Developer1 

Uh, physicians, they work in the generated STL file. 

00:32:02 Interviewer 

 

00:32:03 Developer1 

That people work with just the directory. So in that part is more like actually a type of memory model development. 

00:32:14 Interviewer 

 

00:32:14 Developer1 

Because they are every always with us. We are just to. This is correctly is test it to me. OK, it's. 

00:32:29 Developer1 

It's it's, uh, it's 

00:32:31 Developer1 

Difficult to to just tell that we. 

00:32:36 Developer1 

Are following, uh? 

00:32:39 Developer1 

Develop model very close. 

00:32:42 Developer1 

But we I think it they they are. 

00:32:42 Interviewer 

Yeah, gotcha. 

00:32:45 Developer1 

The main develop models that we follow waterfall and the agile. 

00:32:51 Interviewer 

Yeah OK, gotcha. So uh. Normally how I I would. I was wondering normally how what is the frequency of update? 

00:33:02 Interviewer 

I mean, if someone requests his new feature normally, how long does this person wait until the feature is released? 

00:33:12 Developer1 

Uh, some features we we don't, uh, it's. 

00:33:18 Developer1 

We we. 

00:33:20 Developer1 

Uh, try to generate a new version to that person. They OK, then he use it it. But we sometimes we don't, uh, generate a new version because we don't have enough, uh, new features to release a new version. 

00:33:41 Developer1 

I think how much time you all. 

00:33:44 Developer2 

Do you think trees? 

00:33:44 Developer2 

 

00:33:44 Developer2 

 

00:33:47 Developer2 

One one year, it's depends. It's six months, two one year. 

00:33:57 Developer2 

And now now it's 222 years. 

00:34:03 Developer2 

Two or three travel years ago. The last she please. 

00:34:10 Developer1 

I think it's two years. It's because we. 

00:34:14 Developer2 

It's for for all for. 

00:34:15 Developer1 

 

00:34:16 Developer2 

All but she we generated specifically for for partners like the the physicians of Notable Navigation. 

00:34:22 Interviewer 

 

00:34:28 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:34:29 Developer2 

For for all people. 

00:34:30 Developer2 

 

00:34:30 Developer2 

 

00:34:32 Developer2 

Yeah, I think he one year. 

00:34:34 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:34:36 Interviewer 

Yeah, thanks so the next question is about the project management process. What is your project management process and do you think improving this process can tackle the current problems? 

00:34:51 Interviewer 

Uh, since you told me that the current problems is. 

00:34:55 Interviewer 

Uh, lacking access to images, so maybe they are irrelevant probably, but can improving this process tackle some other problems? 

00:35:05 Interviewer 

So and have you used any project management tools? 

00:35:11 Developer1 

Uh, we just follow the GitHub process. We don't have a, uh, any. We don't use any type of other tool, OK? 

00:35:14 Developer1 

Yeah, OK. 

00:35:14 Developer1 

 

00:35:21 Developer1 

Yeah, we try to to have a work, uh? 

00:35:21 

 

00:35:27 Developer1 

To have a some uh agenda to to follow. Wow we are working with this feature. Then we we work with that feature but we don't follow any, uh? 

00:35:32 Developer1 

Working with. 

00:35:32 Developer1 

 

00:35:40 Interviewer 

OK, so. 

00:35:40 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:35:41 Interviewer 

So suppose suppose you work with a physician and this physician requested a new feature. Where do you record this new feature? Where do you record your plans for developing this feature? 

00:35:56 Developer2 

In the week recharge issue. 

00:36:01 Interviewer 

Sorry, can you repeat that issues OK? 

00:36:02 Developer2 

He he he, he issues issues yes. 

00:36:02 Developer2 

He he he he issues yes. 

00:36:05 Developer1 

Yeah, but the the the features are mainly documented at emails. 

00:36:14 Developer1 

The physician singles email what he wants, then we try to reply it. Then we have more requests than we. We try to maintain there. 

00:36:16 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:36:18 Interviewer 

Yeah, yeah. 

00:36:28 Developer2 

 

00:36:29 Interviewer 

OK, got you. Thanks the next one is the correctness of software. I think I mentioned it a little bit. 

00:36:37 Interviewer 

I mentioned about the tests for the software, so is there any obstacle for the correctness of software? Have you what methods have? 

00:36:50 Interviewer 

Been considered or practiced to improve the situation. 

00:36:57 Developer1 

Yes, uh. 

00:36:59 Developer1 

We we don't have, for example, unit tests. 

00:37:04 Developer1 

You know where we try to? 

00:37:06 Developer1 

We want to do to have unit tests because it allow us to. 

00:37:13 Developer1 

Uh, writing new features fix new bugs. Yeah, we thought, uh, knowing that the new feature or this new fix. 

00:37:24 Developer1 

Don't, uh, affect that other parts of values. We don't have the this uh, unit test tests, so that's the problem we want to. 

00:37:39 Developer1 

To fix in development of English values. 

00:37:42 Interviewer 

 

00:37:44 Interviewer 

Yeah, I think writing unit tests can be time consuming. 

00:37:49 Developer1 

Uh, the other problem is. 

00:37:50 Interviewer 

I don't like that part. 

00:37:52 Developer1 

Yeah, so some parts of England Dallas are very, uh, visual. 

00:37:57 Developer1 

Uh, like we wanted to generate 3D files, uh, to render. 

00:37:58 Interviewer 

 

00:38:03 

 

00:38:04 Developer1 

And things like that. So we it's difficult to do unique spaces in at that case, so we have to stop it sometime. 

00:38:14 Developer1 

Uh, studied what the other developers are doing. In those cases, it try to apply it in designers. 

00:38:24 Interviewer 

OK, got you. 

00:38:26 Interviewer 

But supposedly a physician requests a new feature, uh, does this person normally provide some maybe datasets for you for testing? 

00:38:38 Interviewer 

Or do you have to find these images and datasets by yourselves? 

00:38:43 Developer1 

They, uh. 

00:38:46 Developer1 

They, uh, we they. 

00:38:50 Developer1 

Send it to us. The upset with the emails, but we try to. 

00:38:55 Developer1 

To find other data sets because sometime is we try to test if that is working with other images. 

00:38:58 Interviewer 

Yeah, of course. 

00:39:05 Interviewer 

OK, yeah. 

00:39:08 Interviewer 

 

00:39:10 Interviewer 

So my next question is about the maintainability of the software South when designing this workflow, where did you consider the ease of future changes? 

00:39:22 Interviewer 

For example, where it would be harder to change the structure of the system modules, or maybe code blocks in the future. 

00:39:31 Developer1 

Well, yes, we try to. 

00:39:34 Developer1 

To consider, uh, these of changes. 

00:39:39 Developer1 

Uh, but the sometimes the people, the physicians. 

00:39:46 Developer1 

Ask us about some new features. 

00:39:51 Developer1 

Are very different from what we have at in Dallas. OK, like for instance, uh, they want us to have a. 

00:39:55 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:39:55 Interviewer 

 

00:39:55 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:39:55 Interviewer 

 

00:39:57 Interviewer 

 

00:40:01 Developer1 

Rich reduced one image in order because sometimes they they wanted to. 

00:40:08 Interviewer 

 

00:40:09 Developer1 

Uh, to have, uh, informations about two types of uh, medical images in one? Yeah, because they wanted. 

00:40:16 

 

00:40:17 Interviewer 

 

00:40:17 Interviewer 

 

00:40:20 Developer1 

To have two images at one time, two is in the process of uh. 

00:40:23 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:40:27 Developer1 

Uh, obtaining more information about that case, you know where they they want to put it, for instance, uh? 

00:40:35 Developer1 

 

00:40:36 Developer1 

 

00:40:38 Developer1 

Yeah, right, because if you we we have there is more information about bonds in the MRI. Having more information about the brain the the problem is in values. Just work with one uh image at time when such of images. 

00:40:39 Interviewer 

Oh, OK. 

00:40:58 Developer1 

Have time so that's the problem, because we. 

00:40:59 Interviewer 

 

00:41:04 Developer1 

It it it will. 

00:41:07 Developer1 

Require us to do some modifications at the destructor of Finger Silas. 

00:41:14 Developer1 

But we try to to do some, uh, to be very generic at the insert duration of fingers Alice, but sometime is. 

00:41:24 Developer1 

There is needed to do very different work, so we have to do, uh. 

00:41:32 Developer1 

Uh, DP modification. So not how is it possible to have a easy of changes to the logs? 

00:41:40 Interviewer 

 

00:41:42 Developer2 

Wait, uh, we created. 

00:41:44 Developer2 

A plug in architecture for small tools. 

00:41:46 Interviewer 

 

00:41:50 Developer1 

 

00:41:51 Developer2 

Is indicated for for small tools, specific tools like a you create a new filter. For example it's using the plug in architecture, but it's big tools is more hard. 

00:42:01 Interviewer 

 

00:42:11 Developer2 

You was looking for. 

00:42:13 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:42:15 Developer1 

Yeah yeah, but but we try to. 

00:42:18 Developer1 

Consider the ease of change, but sometimes it's not possible because we. 

00:42:24 Developer1 

The actor often values don't follow, don't, uh, uh. 

00:42:28 Interviewer 

 

00:42:31 Developer1 

It's not easy to maintain that territory with that new. 

00:42:36 Developer2 

 

00:42:37 Interviewer 

OK, yeah, uh, I heard a hard line example. 

00:42:38 Developer1 

 

00:42:38 Developer1 

 

00:42:43 Interviewer 

Those developers they developed a core part of the software and then they asked the users themselves, or maybe then just the developers themselves. They developed the extensions so maybe new features if they have new features they just develop new. 

00:43:04 Interviewer 

Extensions to the software. Do you guys do you guys think this is a good idea? 

00:43:09 Interviewer 

I really want to have some opinions from you guys because you are experienced developers. 

00:43:16 Developer1 

 

00:43:18 Developer1 

The the problem with this type of. 

00:43:22 Developer1 

Thing is, for instance, we have that software named Slicer is a very good software. It has every type of feature. It's very cool. 

00:43:36 Developer1 

 

00:43:37 Developer1 

But it's a very difficult software to use it because it it has a lot of models. They it's not a a software made to. 

00:43:43 Interviewer 

OK, yeah. 

00:43:50 Developer1 

Be used by normal people. 

00:43:53 Developer2 

They step by step. 

00:43:54 Developer1 

 

00:43:56 Developer1 

Yeah, we try to to follow other type of mentality. We want to have a soft. 

00:44:02 Developer1 

Sir, that is easy to use so we we don't want to to have a lot of Windows jumping that things so it's a little difficult to to follow this. 

00:44:18 Developer1 

These type of developments at Alice. 

00:44:21 

 

00:44:22 Developer1 

And other other problem is. 

00:44:25 Developer1 

We don't have a a lot of, uh, other people trying to help us with development, so yeah. 

00:44:31 Developer1 

OK. 

00:44:31 Developer1 

 

00:44:33 Interviewer 

Yeah, that can be a problem. Yeah, thanks. 

00:44:35 Developer1 

 

00:44:38 Interviewer 

My next question is about the understandability. So can you provide maybe some instances about where users have misunderstood the software? 

00:44:52 Interviewer 

So maybe they misunderstood, maybe some icons or some functions. Or maybe the purpose of the software. Can you provide provide any examples? 

00:45:06 Developer1 

For instance, uh, I think there's Alice. We have, uh, likely in some old navigators that. 

00:45:13 Interviewer 

 

00:45:15 Developer1 

Progress bar in the status bar at the bottom of the window. Yeah, so we when we are. 

00:45:18 Developer2 

 

00:45:24 Developer1 

 

00:45:25 Developer1 

The winning software is doing some, uh, hard working like generating, uh? 

00:45:32 Developer1 

Uh, the mesh, for instance it will meet may take a lot of time, so we use that that progress bar to indicate to the user that we that in Dallas is work. 

00:45:42 Interviewer 

 

00:45:46 Developer1 

In the what is the? 

00:45:50 Developer1 

Progress of that task. OK, but some some users don't see that progress bar there. OK, so they think ah it is uh yeah it stopped. Oh it stopped working so we try it now to. 

00:45:52 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:45:52 Interviewer 

 

00:46:01 Interviewer 

That stopped working. 

00:46:10 Developer1 

To jump, uh, a little dialog window with that progress bar with a. 

00:46:14 Interviewer 

Ah, OK. 

00:46:18 Developer1 

Timer and things like that. That's a, uh. 

00:46:23 Developer1 

 

00:46:26 Developer1 

Uh, example other bother is for instance we have a. 

00:46:31 Developer1 

UH-1 type of segmentation, namely, the watershed. 

00:46:36 Interviewer 

 

00:46:36 Developer1 

At the at that two, the the person will have to mark what he wants in that image and what he doesn't want. 

00:46:47 Interviewer 

 

00:46:47 Developer1 

But, uh, sometimes the the user don't understand what it is. That thing is so that yes, it's happening. It's happy sometimes. 

00:47:01 Interviewer 

Happy OK thanks. 

00:47:04 Interviewer 

Uh, next question is about usability. 

00:47:08 Interviewer 

Uh, have you taken any actions to address usability issues? I think you mentioned that for some very complex software with a lot of assumptions, maybe they are not easy to use, so have you done any actions to improve the situation? 

00:47:29 Developer1 

For instance, I think as Alice, we try to to have a step by step at work. 

00:47:36 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:47:38 Developer1 

We we have numbered steps at the left part of a window of Alice. 

00:47:46 Developer1 

A user starts, uh, opening a file, then segmentation, segmenting, then generating a. 

00:47:55 Developer2 

Asterio file. 

00:47:55 Developer1 

The the mesh lane exporting the excess STL file. 

00:48:01 Developer1 

We try to follow these, uh, these step by step uh idea, because it's very, uh, easy to the users to follow. 

00:48:13 Developer1 

Uh, other? 

00:48:16 Developer1 

Like it we I said before, uh? 

00:48:20 Developer1 

Try to use that dialog box with progress bar to show that 2 user that in Visalia is doing some working is not. 

00:48:29 Interviewer 

He's yeah. 

00:48:31 Developer1 

It's Turkey or he's not he he was doesn't crash there. Things like that. OK, yeah, but uh and likely we that we said it before. We don't want to have a lot of models models that are not very easy to to use. 

00:48:50 Developer1 

Like in case of his leiser, Leiser is a very very cute software. We don't have problem with that, but it's difficult to use software to use. 

00:49:01 Developer1 

Even to us we have to take sometimes to passive some things like in there. 

00:49:05 Interviewer 

Yeah yeah yeah. Selector is also in our list and just had a conversation with Steve, the main architect of Slicer. And we also talked about this. 

00:49:19 Interviewer 

Yes, slicer. 

00:49:21 Interviewer 

Maybe has a lot of complex functions, yeah? 

00:49:25 Developer2 

 

00:49:25 Developer2 

 

00:49:27 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:49:27 Developer2 

No, the the the problem is it's, uh, users. The healthy users is much Fuji computer. 

00:49:33 Interviewer 

 

00:49:36 Developer1 

 

00:49:36 Developer2 

There are users. 

00:49:38 

 

00:49:40 Developer2 

 

00:49:41 Interviewer 

The learning curve for sensors maybe is yeah, more steep. More time to learn Slicer. 

00:49:49 Developer2 

 

00:49:52 Interviewer 

OK, two questions left. OK, we are very efficient. 

00:50:00 

 

00:50:00 Interviewer 

So next question is about documentation. 

00:50:03 Interviewer 

Do you think the current documentation can clearly convey or necessary knowledge to the users? 

00:50:11 Interviewer 

Uh, if yes, how did you successfully achieve it? If no, what improvements are needed? 

00:50:19 Developer1 

In the silence, as a user documentation, we try to document each tool we have ACTEMRA silos. What that do do? What are the parameters? 

00:50:33 Developer1 

But, uh, we we what we don't have it now at documentation is how do the things like for instance I. 

00:50:42 Developer1 

I have this MRI image. I want to segment the brain at that image all using eval. Use to do that to do that. 

00:50:53 Developer1 

Task so that type of problem is not documented at the main documentation of embezzles. What we have in now. But we have just a little videos is videos with uh. 

00:50:54 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:51:04 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:51:14 Developer1 

We see tutorials like I do you want to segment this image? Do that you want to export. Do that OK? 

00:51:25 Developer1 

The the that type of a tutorial is very good to use to the users. Uh, we, it's. 

00:51:34 Developer1 

That that's the the thing where, uh, in Dallas won't more, uh, want to know, uh, need more, OK? 

00:51:42 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:51:43 Developer1 

 

00:51:44 Developer1 

We we had, we gave some classes to some users. So the main problem is we don't have many documentations or tutorials. 

00:51:57 Interviewer 

 

00:51:57 Interviewer 

 

00:51:57 Developer1 

Uh, telling to the showing to the the user whole to do that, but we have a good documentation about the tools, uh, that's the what we needed to improve. 

00:52:08 Interviewer 

OK, so about the communications. 

00:52:12 Interviewer 

Normally, how do you communicate with the users? Do you communicate with via emails or maybe on GitHub issues? 

00:52:19 Interviewer 

How do you discuss the usage of the software? 

00:52:23 Developer1 

Uh, emails always OK. 

00:52:27 Developer2 

Website contact form contact. 

00:52:31 Interviewer 

OK yeah, it's unhappy for me, yeah. 

00:52:32 Developer2 

And and did you have issues? 

00:52:36 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:52:36 Developer1 

Uh, at the city we not. Not now because we are working from home, but when when we were working there locally, we used to receive a lot of of. 

00:52:47 

 

00:52:52 Developer1 

Uh, visits they. They they were, there they are there for other things, but they they see that in Dallas they. 

00:52:54 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:53:01 Developer1 

Starts to talk with us, but other times other times there is people who come to talk with us directly. So there is a lot of type of. 

00:53:13 Developer1 

Main uh to to contact us but mainly is for from by email. 

00:53:19 Interviewer 

Yeah, OK. 

00:53:21 Interviewer 

Yeah, and you mentioned that you provide trainings to people. I think that's a very interesting idea. Maybe trainings workshop? I think maybe they will be helpful. It's my first time here this idea I think is interesting. 

00:53:36 Developer1 

Yeah, it's a very good idea. We gave, uh, some tutorials at. 

00:53:42 Developer1 

Last year and the a lot of people participated that that a tutorial was very good. 

00:53:47 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:53:51 Interviewer 

Yeah, sounds good. 

00:53:55 Developer2 

How we find it in those orders? 

00:53:59 Interviewer 

Uh, what I? 

00:54:00 Developer2 

 

00:54:00 Developer2 

 

00:54:02 Interviewer 

I cannot remember how I basically find, uh, your software, but I can tell you how I built the third. 

00:54:10 Interviewer 

Key software list. So I have about maybe four resources. The first is Googling medical imaging software. I found some articles giving recommendations for good software. The second is I I search. 

00:54:31 Interviewer 

The the papers, academic papers, some papers they compare different software. 

00:54:35 Developer2 

 

00:54:41 Interviewer 

Uh, the third is we have domain experts, so our domain experts. They work in medical imaging areas. Maybe they do not develop software themselves, but they use them so they give us some suggestions and we I eventually got about. 

00:55:03 Interviewer 

It's 40 or 50, maybe 50 different software, but I had to get rid of some of them. Some of them were too old. 

00:55:11 Interviewer 

Maybe they they were not maintained for maybe 10 years. 15 years. I got rid of them of of my list. Some of them. They are free software but they are not open source. 

00:55:17 Developer1 

 

00:55:27 Interviewer 

For some studies, we need to analyze the source code, so I got rid of them and eventually I got my 30 software about 3029. I think in the list. 

00:55:40 Interviewer 

So yeah, that's how I got all these software. 

00:55:45 Interviewer 

Sorry, sorry that's not a direct answer to your question, but I don't really remember how I got in words. 

00:55:53 Interviewer 

 

00:55:54 Developer1 

OK, OK. 

00:55:56 Interviewer 

Yeah, and I think that's my last question. It's about the reproducibility. Do you have any concern that your computational results won't be reproducible in the future? And have you taken any steps to it? 

00:56:14 Interviewer 

Ensure reproducibility. 

00:56:14 Interviewer 

 

00:56:16 

 

00:56:18 Developer1 

Yes, we have, but we want to have a unit test too. 

00:56:23 Developer1 

Yeah to. 

00:56:26 Developer1 

To ensure the reproducibility. OK, we don't have it now. 

00:56:31 Developer1 

Yeah, OK, uh. 

00:56:34 Developer1 

But we try to everything we do at in results after the new developing we try to test it manually. No try to open all type of images. We have access to some computations so it. 

00:56:34 

 

00:56:42 Interviewer 

 

00:56:47 

 

00:56:53 Developer1 

It's not a. 

00:56:56 Developer1 

Very easy now to ensure that. But we try yeah. 

00:57:02 Interviewer 

OK. 

00:57:03 Interviewer 

Thank you, I think those are all of my questions and yeah, I'm I'm gonna. 

00:57:13 Interviewer 

Stop recording.
