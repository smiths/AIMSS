00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.929
Interviewer: So start your second recording all right.

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:18.570
Interviewer: Thank you for participating in this interview and our first question for you is that group, please give us some brief introduction about yourself, maybe your position or title and there are degrades.

3
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.780
Developer: So i'm he.

4
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.930
Developer: i'm French living in Spain.

5
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.560
Developer: My time my study was more physics, but then.

6
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.270
Developer: It went towards biomedical engineering.

7
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.640
Developer: And mostly then programming.

8
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.500
Developer: In that context.

9
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:50.100
Developer: And the different works well yeah either in some kind of small companies or in university so.

10
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.530
Developer: At the limit between investigation and development real development.

11
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.720
Developer: And these days so it's it's that i'm working for violence and startup who does.

12
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.740
Developer: image diagnostic online.

13
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.200
Interviewer: Okay.

14
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.820
Interviewer: I think you already mentioned it, that but currently is give us a little bit more details about your relationship with.

15
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.040
Interviewer: The software.

16
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.990
Interviewer: Such has.

17
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.820
Interviewer: Your maybe your responsibilities for this open here.

18
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.060
Developer: So for the dwp.

19
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.080
Interviewer: And that's right.

20
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.000
Developer: Good apple is so many before I was more working on a.

21
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.130
Developer: computer programs so who physically run on the machine so mostly c++ stuff.

22
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.300
Developer: And then so something like 10 years ago.

23
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.670
Developer: which now seems quite a long time.

24
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.760
Developer: I found out that you could do the same thing on the browser.

25
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.550
Developer: And yeah after after having.

26
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:13.770
Developer: painfully built and compile and done stuff for locally run programs just being able to see a documentary john the brother looked fantastic for me and so that's when I started the project.

27
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.310
Developer: mainly as a side thing because.

28
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.810
Developer: It looked like it would be kind of the future.

29
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.210
Developer: Nowadays.

30
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:36.660
Developer: It is not completely as as future as I thought, but it is, and so I started that just true for myself on so technologies, I didn't know javascript and.

31
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:52.770
Developer: Mainly an html for the browser and playing with the canvas stuff and so that's how I started the project and then, at the same time github was kind of starting also know, was quite young.

32
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.400
Developer: And so it was quite funny to put all the code online and having some people interact with me.

33
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.410
Interviewer: yeah myself is also a software engineer and i'm.

34
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:16.410
Interviewer: For most part, health of my personal time I developed web Apps so I agree that web Apps are more maybe more coming in, for most people a vendor traditional programs.

35
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:32.460
Interviewer: list clustering is not holidays, but i'm curious that what's the difference of performance, since you may be transferred from the C or c++ to javascript did you see any performance job for their software.

36
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:42.180
Developer: Yes, you have to be careful i've not in so I have not yet developed in the viewer highly.

37
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.890
Developer: Competitive national algorithms but still for some stuff that are quite basic in c++.

38
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.260
Developer: You have to be careful, on the web APP.

39
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.900
Developer: So, for example, there's a tool we're using the.

40
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.210
Developer: The controls that you can imitate with the with the gradient.

41
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.680
Developer: yeah and so, so this one takes a bit of time.

42
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.260
Developer: And I need to optimize it a lot.

43
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.300
Developer: For it to be really usable.

44
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.450
Developer: So So yes, you can you notice it yes.

45
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.080
Interviewer: yeah thanks thanks for suggestions okay My next question is about.

46
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:36.420
Interviewer: Sorry, how long I said I need you to say it again, how long have you been we're working with this project so maybe more every time.

47
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:46.320
Developer: Something like 10 years, I think, would have to check when was the first comment, but I think it was 2012.

48
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.840
Developer: Okay yeah.

49
00:04:51.600 --> 00:05:05.850
Interviewer: So you said other cells are there any other developers working on this project, maybe, can you give us an estimate estimation, about the size of a group that development group.

50
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.870
Developer: said, the size of group is mainly me.

51
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.440
Developer: I have people who come and go.

52
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.190
hmm.

53
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.950
Developer: But they usually don't stay that much.

54
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.010
Developer: Because, maybe they change positions or they don't have enough time to still contribute.

55
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.590
Developer: Okay, but no it's mainly me, plus a Max two or three at the same time.

56
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:32.160
Okay.

57
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.610
Developer: i've been in contact with a few companies who wanted to use the software and.

58
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.580
Developer: Sometimes so did they want something, and maybe they would come to me and ask for stuff.

59
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.140
Developer: But there's there's there's.

60
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.300
Developer: No real client.

61
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.830
Developer: Okay, a thought.

62
00:05:49.920 --> 00:06:00.000
Developer: Then from the company, where I work in so that's quite a big change, for me, since last summer, before I was doing it on the side from my official job.

63
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.140
Developer: and

64
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:09.870
Developer: it's only been since last summer that i've been employed to develop that thing and being able to still put some code open source.

65
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:24.720
Interviewer: Okay, and by the two to three people if there are some of them German the of facial group or did you included that people may be making some poor requests on github.

66
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.480
Developer: I yeah so i've got a quite a few pull requests made.

67
00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.890
Developer: By people and.

68
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.200
Developer: So I don't know if you didn't.

69
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.660
Developer: You didn't there was no official team.

70
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:40.260
Okay.

71
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.210
Interviewer: Okay that's your.

72
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:49.020
Developer: Job people who come and go, and it will sometimes proposed code.

73
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:49.680
Interviewer: uh huh.

74
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:57.750
Developer: Last year there was some guy was quite active and was being very interesting pull requests to optimize the code.

75
00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:59.280
which was good.

76
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.140
Developer: So that.

77
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.180
Developer: kinda like that the interaction.

78
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.240
Interviewer: yeah so for these poll requests.

79
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:18.420
Interviewer: Are these the major like the major mathers to make contributions to this project, how to help you accepted the contributions to this project.

80
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.050
Developer: So yes, many via pull requests.

81
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:22.860
Interviewer: mm hmm.

82
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:28.650
Developer: So yeah people would propose some code and I would review it.

83
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:36.270
Developer: discuss with them if there's something that bothers me or that I don't understand and I usually accept it.

84
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.800
Interviewer: Is there another way to make a contribution to this project.

85
00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.630
Interviewer: or just pull request.

86
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.590
Developer: I think some people try to send me stuff by mail.

87
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:50.220
Interviewer: mm hmm.

88
00:07:50.250 --> 00:08:01.560
Developer: Sometimes so code by mail, but then it's I have to do myself to pull request and check the code and launch all the tests so it's not that easy, so I.

89
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:02.760
Developer: Would yeah I pray holy.

90
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.450
Interviewer: yeah I think i'm poor has I think he's he's.

91
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.970
Interviewer: From my personal perspective.

92
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:25.080
Interviewer: yeah okay My next question is about the background of the developers, you told me that there are people coming and going so to know what's the code back we're on our developers.

93
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:30.510
Developer: And I don't usually ask them.

94
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.000
Developer: So it's more about feeling.

95
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:40.890
Developer: But these guys are more they're working in companies yeah and who seem to be doing something related to imaging.

96
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:41.670
Interviewer: Okay.

97
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:46.110
Developer: And I need a viewer, so I would suppose programming background.

98
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:49.230
Developer: Okay, so, then I don't know much more yeah.

99
00:08:49.650 --> 00:09:00.930
Interviewer: yeah I think that's good enough answer, thank you, so perhaps perhaps programming background, instead of medical background, can we assume that.

100
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.080
Developer: At some point.

101
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.390
Developer: I think.

102
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:13.950
Developer: Quite at the beginning, there was i've been in contact with a few doctors who were doing some proclamation.

103
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:22.740
Developer: mm hmm, but these days, not that much but, at the beginning, yes, there was a guy was doing a web APP.

104
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.490
Interviewer: yeah.

105
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.920
Developer: And I think another one who started to do the i've done a plugin for wordpress.

106
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.780
Developer: And the guy who.

107
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.970
Developer: Now he hadn't program that he was suggesting to do it.

108
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.790
Interviewer: Okay yeah thanks.

109
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.360
Developer: So yeah not that many doctors yeah.

110
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:42.750
Okay.

111
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:53.190
Interviewer: So my next question is about to the number of users, what is your estimated number of users and how did you come up with this estimation.

112
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.280
Developer: And so I don't know.

113
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:10.410
Developer: So the, the only in the case, but I don't know if they still do use the thing, so the software is released under the gdpr license.

114
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:17.490
Developer: yeah and so sometimes i've had companies who were asking okay GPS is not useful for us.

115
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:25.080
Developer: Could you do a less restrictive license and at that point, I usually do a.

116
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:36.630
Developer: I might do whatever less restrictive license so this I keep a record of them and I maybe have something like 20.

117
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.310
Developer: But I don't know if they still are using the software or not.

118
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:42.420
Okay.

119
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:57.030
Interviewer: Okay, this question is is not on that list you mentioned that some companies may come and use this software, the web, how do they use it and i'm wondering that do they.

120
00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:04.950
Interviewer: combine the Web to their own product, maybe to make another product is that the case.

121
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:13.830
Developer: I I guess so that's a bit the point of the web, I mean it doesn't have any dependencies or anything.

122
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.950
Developer: least possible and the aim is to include that thing in your framework.

123
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:30.780
Developer: Okay, so i've got so the main repository is the web, but then i've got example repositories who mainly develop a client in a framework.

124
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.920
Developer: So i've got a few example so ankle the react of you.

125
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:42.180
Developer: And jquery and so these are the clients, with a framework and that language that uses the web.

126
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.250
Developer: So the aim of the debris is.

127
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.020
Developer: To be integrated in something is.

128
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.870
Developer: Okay, and sometimes people will use directly the example clients.

129
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.350
Developer: But mostly I think in companies that will rebuild them.

130
00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:07.200
Interviewer: Okay, fair I got another curious question suppose a company developed a web APP will give you that little bit was a as one of the dependency.

131
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:18.900
Interviewer: For that were bad maybe there is a react front end and some kind of backhand you think that the web, we are only be working on the front end and the not in the back.

132
00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.510
Developer: yeah the name of.

133
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.890
Developer: The room is front end is.

134
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.740
Developer: Out there was no interaction.

135
00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:32.520
Developer: anticipated with the with some back end that's the only interaction will be by loading the icons but.

136
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.430
Developer: Nothing run on the back.

137
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.550
Interviewer: So, for now, the web is not.

138
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:46.050
Interviewer: available for maybe you know that jazz or maybe some back end packages right back in.

139
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.030
Developer: February, you could use it just.

140
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.870
Developer: I mean the thing doesn't try to display anything.

141
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.250
Developer: So loading the diagram and converting it to an image.

142
00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:06.840
Developer: file in the format of the web is still doable in a note, so if ever you wanted to do some kind of daikon file manipulation, you could still use it in the back.

143
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:14.700
Interviewer: Okay, thank you baby husbands, are only because of the maker St okay my next question on the list.

144
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:23.850
Interviewer: Do you have any idea of the typical background of a user, I think we are asking the end users.

145
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:31.680
Interviewer: Maybe not him yeah perhaps you can say they are those companies and making their when products.

146
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:41.550
Interviewer: Or do you have any any idea of the inner users who are they maybe they are masters students or maybe medical workers do you have any idea.

147
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:49.920
Developer: From the different contacts i've had I think so either doctors.

148
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:51.390
Who.

149
00:13:52.920 --> 00:14:02.820
Developer: So either are trying to do some so using the viewers some kind of died found on the diagnostic but just to check the image and see how to quickly check.

150
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:10.530
Developer: yeah or otherwise, they use it as an education to educational tool, so they they will show.

151
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:18.390
Developer: data and maybe point to some stuff and navigate through it, which was the point of their the wordpress plugin was more for that.

152
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.590
Developer: Okay, beginning.

153
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:27.660
Developer: So either doctors, yes or then maybe sometimes i've had contacts with people doing.

154
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.160
Developer: So annotations in.

155
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:39.060
Developer: In all the Ai world we we have at the moment there's a need for a lot of annotated data.

156
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:44.490
Developer: And so, using the viewer to be able to annotate zone and then save it.

157
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:50.220
Developer: And that's beans few context about chicken eggs wanted that.

158
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.350
Interviewer: Okay, thanks.

159
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:58.800
Developer: So, then, the user, will be a maybe a student or somebody annotating.

160
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.910
Okay.

161
00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.350
Developer: Medical student or maybe physics or.

162
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:05.850
Interviewer: huh.

163
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:07.080
Interviewer: yeah.

164
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:13.920
Interviewer: Are at my next question is about the obstacles in your development process.

165
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.310
Interviewer: Now currently do have any significant obstacles in your development process.

166
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.370
Developer: Apart from not having enough time.

167
00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.560
Developer: I don't think so.

168
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:42.960
Developer: Most of the good example that the standard, everything is available online so there's nothing that I don't have access to.

169
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.890
Okay.

170
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:50.490
Developer: Maybe I don't have enough users to do some usability study.

171
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:59.970
Developer: But apart from that, I think most of the stuff is there, if ever there was problems or.

172
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:04.170
Developer: I didn't have enough knowledge to understand something.

173
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.610
Developer: Good until now it hasn't happened.

174
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:10.890
Developer: Maybe because i've just.

175
00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:23.190
Developer: scratched the surface of daikon and maybe didn't go too much in deep in some some real problem, but then there are forums to understand icon and everything, so I guess, there would be ways to have more information.

176
00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.180
Interviewer: yeah.

177
00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.580
Developer: So no I thought, from time no I don't think so.

178
00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:28.080
Developer: yeah we'll look back on.

179
00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:36.150
Interviewer: Okay, approximately how much how many hours, do you think you put into this project every week.

180
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.940
Developer: Before last summer.

181
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:46.890
Developer: I was mainly doing that, on my free time.

182
00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:47.550
Interviewer: mm hmm.

183
00:16:49.980 --> 00:17:03.060
Developer: depended on the moment if if ever I had time I would do it, and if not, I would not, and these days, but the it's it's the main part of my current job.

184
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:13.920
Developer: Then there is part of the job, which is aimed at the company and development for the company and some stuff that I try to translate or to pass to the Open Source thing.

185
00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:22.650
Developer: So I don't know if your question is how much time I can spend on working on the Open Source project.

186
00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:23.970
Interviewer: Not.

187
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.080
Developer: Not on an open.

188
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.020
Interviewer: source project, but for a dw specifically.

189
00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:32.280
Developer: But dw is the Open Source project and because.

190
00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.310
Developer: We, we have the another name for the thing.

191
00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:36.510
and

192
00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.510
Developer: So I don't know it's.

193
00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:50.190
Developer: Now i've got more time, but, at the beginning let's so I don't know it's from from last year it's maybe half half of my work time is at least.

194
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.640
Interviewer: yeah yeah Thank you and.

195
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.250
Interviewer: So.

196
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:05.640
Interviewer: Do you think you may be able to change your development process to remove or reduce today's obstacle this.

197
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.340
Interviewer: Not having enough time to go.

198
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:21.600
Developer: I don't think it would it's a question of process here it's just maybe having more people contributing trying to motivate more people.

199
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.910
Developer: But the process would not change much of that no.

200
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:27.720
Okay.

201
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:29.910
Interviewer: yeah thanks.

202
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:49.170
Interviewer: My next question is about documentation, so how does documentation fit into your development process and do think improving improving documentation, we are help with the OPS hose you just mentioned they're lacking over time.

203
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.900
Developer: And so I I try to document as much as I can.

204
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.720
Developer: and publish documentation at each release.

205
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.640
Developer: I think, especially for javascript it's quite important, because.

206
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:16.620
Developer: Four rows of a script where you don't know the type of the data and when you it's not clear reading from the code whatever you're passing to methods and functions, I think documentation is quite important.

207
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.280
Developer: to know exactly Okay, what can I give it a number or an object now.

208
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.680
Developer: So I tried to do as much as I can, and publish it.

209
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.360
Developer: Quite a lot.

210
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.100
Developer: But so that's for the code documentation.

211
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:47.970
Developer: And then i'm trying to also to give examples and everything I would say that for open source is quite important now, because if I don't have direct contact with the people who want to play with the tool.

212
00:19:48.540 --> 00:20:01.020
Developer: So if they can't find information they will quickly get to another one I think it's not like in a company, where people are forced to use a tool and then, if even if there is no documentation, they will.

213
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.430
Developer: use that they will come to me.

214
00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.940
Developer: So I tried to do quite an audience.

215
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:16.080
Interviewer: Okay, I also interviewed some other participants they told me that sometimes when they were busy they didn't have enough time.

216
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:35.910
Interviewer: To answer the questions from the users, so they thought to that not all of them, some of them thought that a good documentation may say with some algorithm time because they do have to answer the questions over and over again, do you think this is true for your project.

217
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.750
Developer: I think so, yes, because sometimes i've had.

218
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:50.220
Developer: Repeated questions and at that point, I usually try to so either write it in the some notes a separate documentation or in the wiki on the github.

219
00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:54.360
Developer: So that whenever somebody comes back I just send the link back again.

220
00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:56.820
Developer: So yes, yes.

221
00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:06.840
Developer: Right everything and trying to clarify it quickly and so that I can send it back again yeah it's useful.

222
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:07.800
Okay.

223
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:23.070
Interviewer: Another follow up question is about contribution and the documentation for people who would like to make some contribution to this project to think current domination is good enough to help them.

224
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.340
Developer: provide some guidance.

225
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:26.880
Interviewer: To them.

226
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.200
Developer: I hope so.

227
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:32.820
Developer: But I guess the people, some people will find that it's not enough.

228
00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:42.900
Developer: And if, then I try to stay well i've not had people being rude to me on the on the issues.

229
00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:47.970
Developer: Okay, usually I tried to say okay sorry I didn't have time to do that and i'll try to fix it in the future.

230
00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:51.810
Developer: So yeah.

231
00:21:53.790 --> 00:22:09.450
Interviewer: yeah so my next question is the about obstacles for the obstacles in the past, so in the past, is there any major obstacle to your development process that has been solved and how to solve it.

232
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:20.460
Developer: No, no real.

233
00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.060
Developer: there's no obstacle that I can really think of.

234
00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.640
Developer: Apart from yeah just.

235
00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.210
Developer: giving it more time now to find out solutions.

236
00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:35.880
Developer: Since since i've never been too much.

237
00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:38.850
Developer: Contract constrained by time.

238
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.410
Developer: Because it was a free project, and I.

239
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:48.780
Developer: didn't have too much people asking for deadline, and there are still stuff that I said I would do but i've never done but anyway.

240
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.330
Developer: If ever there's something not working, I just give it more time.

241
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:55.200
Okay.

242
00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:06.720
Developer: Apart from that, then so but just from the start i've been using github and the all the continuous integration tools and I think that.

243
00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.360
Developer: If ever the obstacle was.

244
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.890
Developer: Releasing a version which had problems whenever the previous version didn't have.

245
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.250
Developer: The ci to help, not to do that.

246
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:28.470
Developer: So, so the environment in which you can build open source software, these days, I think, is quite.

247
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:34.440
Developer: friendly and in a way, you have a lot of tools at your disposition to avoid.

248
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:39.660
Developer: Most of the obstacles that I could think of that were there before.

249
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:59.940
Interviewer: yeah I think good hobby is really convenient is a venture nowadays some of the projects that they used to be a host on maybe source source forge or maybe get back get back eight and some of them are moving to github or maybe have already moved to a good tab.

250
00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:05.100
Interviewer: yeah you mentioned the ci tool which said, who do use.

251
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:11.190
Developer: And so i've been using travis for a long time.

252
00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.710
Developer: Okay, but until last year.

253
00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:29.070
Developer: They seem to have changed a bit the policy, and so you only before that you had a limited time for running your your builds but since last year they started to measure that time and give you credits.

254
00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:34.740
Developer: Supposedly from the documentation, you could write them an email and ask for more.

255
00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:35.910
Developer: I tried that.

256
00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:42.570
Developer: And they never answered me so that's why I moved to get up actions yeah at the end of last year.

257
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.820
Interviewer: Oh, I didn't know github actions can be used as the actual behavior China that sounds like.

258
00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:51.180
Developer: It works very well.

259
00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.120
Developer: The same as travis used to.

260
00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:04.800
Developer: Okay, so and it's well integrated with all the github So you see the green take every comment that's working well and everything so it's very good.

261
00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.140
Interviewer: Okay, thanks for letting me know.

262
00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:29.550
Interviewer: Some some developers from other projects, they mentioned that they had some problems with accessing the medical images they told me that, because of the privacy of patients, sometimes they cannot access the medical images they want, did you ever have this problem.

263
00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:32.910
Developer: Not too much.

264
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:41.790
Developer: So, being in the domain for quite some time, I know about a few places where i've got a lot of example data.

265
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:57.090
Developer: Okay, and so this that I tried to cover from the beginning, but then still I still have people who think at this doesn't work on my data and at that point, I asked them Okay, can you share some anonymized data with me.

266
00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:02.070
Developer: yeah and that's my condition to help them if ever they don't send me then I cannot help.

267
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:07.740
Developer: But there is quite a lot of data in on the web, to check.

268
00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:22.020
Interviewer: Okay, thanks My next question is about the development model, what is your software development model, for example, maybe, do you as a wonderful or do you have a jail you mean there's any web developer.

269
00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:24.690
Developer: yeah.

270
00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.870
Developer: it's kind of a free development.

271
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.600
Developer: Maybe no I don't do sprints.

272
00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:40.530
Developer: On myself when I tried to do we try to do it in a company, where I am at the moment, but before that it was just.

273
00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:45.750
Developer: me having a few ideas of stuff that I wanted to implement and then releasing.

274
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:51.330
Developer: Or, there was no real process, I tried to store all the features I want.

275
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:58.320
Developer: So in the issues or github and try to sort them in a way that I feel that people would like to.

276
00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.870
Developer: know so in some that I will.

277
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:02.070
Developer: I will have time.

278
00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:16.800
Developer: there's one which i've ever had time to do, which is npr so i'm not the planner reconstruction, where you build the other views from so you get the data coming in slices and you build other views of the daikon.

279
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:17.490
Interviewer: Okay.

280
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:26.190
Developer: And that wanna since I knew it was a bit complicated i've been postponing it for years, hopefully this will finish it.

281
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:27.330
Okay.

282
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:33.630
Interviewer: yeah that sounds really one of accomplish more complicated here to function.

283
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.230
Interviewer: question is about project management.

284
00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:48.870
Interviewer: What is your project management process, do you think improving this process can tackle the current problem.

285
00:27:49.650 --> 00:28:09.180
Interviewer: I know, for the most part of can you are the only developer so maybe if there is no project management process Maybe you can talk about maybe your project planning process i'll do make a maybe objectives for the for the different steps of the project.

286
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:14.790
Developer: Like I just said.

287
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:22.680
Developer: I tried to talk and classify all the issues that i've been given and that.

288
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.270
Developer: People give me.

289
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.000
Developer: try and find those who.

290
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:36.030
Developer: would not require me to do that before last year, a million that didn't improve involve a lot of working time.

291
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:38.940
Developer: And then go for it.

292
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.040
Developer: And I still have issues that are left for quite a long time.

293
00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:45.390
Interviewer: Okay.

294
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:52.800
Developer: Hopefully now i've got more time so i'll be able to do more complicated formal.

295
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:58.470
Developer: stuff yeah and now these days, so my.

296
00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.790
Developer: Management of the issues goes quite.

297
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.860
Developer: alone, whatever i've been developing in the company, who I am.

298
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:21.540
Developer: So there's been some leads from them, and so there are stuff that i've been implementing inside the company which I then asked for, if I can put them in the open source and, if I can then I do.

299
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.590
Interviewer: Okay, so, so the issues.

300
00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:34.380
Interviewer: Are they like a problem reports, or are they requesting new features, what kind of issues yeah.

301
00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:43.470
Developer: So I use it for everything, so it can be a bug or problems somebody has.

302
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:46.110
Developer: Also, than a feature request.

303
00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:56.070
Interviewer: Okay, so this feature requests, where are they from are they from the direct users of the web.

304
00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:03.570
Interviewer: So maybe I think that maybe it will be better to have some other functions, then they send in a request to.

305
00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:10.230
Developer: That yeah so they either I think of something and then I created an issue to.

306
00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:12.240
Developer: Okay, we call the feature request.

307
00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.400
Developer: Whether it comes from out scientists.

308
00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:20.970
Developer: So people saying okay i'm missing that kind of tool or i'm missing to npr.

309
00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.010
Developer: When will you do it.

310
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:29.700
Interviewer: Okay, so some from yourself and some from the user, but not have some your company read.

311
00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:39.330
Developer: Not not directly but whatever I transfer comes from a necessity that the company had before so.

312
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:47.640
Developer: So it kind of at the end, yes, I do write it but uh yes next.

313
00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:59.220
Interviewer: My next question is about in the correct nice out with the software, was it harder to ensure the correctness of the software and he is there any.

314
00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:06.510
Interviewer: obstacles and what mathers have been considered or practice to improve the situation.

315
00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:33.600
Developer: So So yes, it's not easy to be reproducible and load the data in a good way all the time, so then then i've invested quite a lot of time, yes to to be able to use also the library to write that Conference and that way I can also in my tests have.

316
00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:40.350
Developer: it's always been a problem if ever, you cannot right, you have to have all the data to test it on.

317
00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:46.770
Developer: Being able to write the data means that I can have a quick json configuration.

318
00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:50.520
Developer: That will generate for me data on the fly during the test.

319
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.850
Developer: And allow me to then test Okay, can I read it properly.

320
00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:58.650
Developer: Okay, so that i've invested quite a lot of time to do that.

321
00:31:59.490 --> 00:31:59.790
Interviewer: Okay.

322
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.190
Developer: To be sure that i'm loading, the same thing.

323
00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:04.980
Developer: Always property.

324
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:08.070
Developer: yeah and the same on the saving the.

325
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:27.060
Developer: In the debris you can also draw shapes and so I can allow you allow people to save these shapes in a state file, and so I had quite a quite a lot of tests be sure that I can still draw and sand show these drawers property.

326
00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:35.880
Interviewer: Okay, and you mentioned some libraries for writing that come to me.

327
00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:40.650
Developer: I use the Web it's code okay okay.

328
00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:47.700
Interviewer: So, so you wrote the algorithm algorithms for reading and writing.

329
00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:49.890
Interviewer: They can't bail us out okay.

330
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:50.940
Interviewer: Yes, well, I think.

331
00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:55.620
Developer: That the writing I also had some help.

332
00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:03.480
Developer: from people who seem to want to use it to write daikon.

333
00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:04.410
Okay.

334
00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:12.030
Developer: I forgot exactly in what context, but I had a few pull request to help me do that.

335
00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.050
Okay.

336
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:15.870
Developer: Because his writing is quite a mess.

337
00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:18.120
Developer: it's not that easy.

338
00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:20.580
Interviewer: Okay yeah.

339
00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.810
Interviewer: Thanks man next question is about.

340
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:46.020
Interviewer: The maintainer is maintain ability of the software, so when does any other software, did you consider the the ease of future change, for example, in the future, barely to be harder to change the structure of the fifth 10 the modules or maybe the quarter blocks.

341
00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:53.580
Developer: Also yeah i'll try to think about architecture as much as I can.

342
00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:59.220
Developer: But sometimes you're in a hurry and so you just go for the easy one, but.

343
00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.520
Developer: I put quite a lot of time, for example in all the loading process.

344
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.600
Developer: To be able to load things from different sources.

345
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:13.560
Developer: And having some kind of flexible scheme.

346
00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:28.770
Developer: At the beginning, also the code was not that independent from the frameworks and so that I improved through time to allow for integration and stuff like angular.

347
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:37.890
Developer: yeah so I tried to think about architecture as much as I can, so that, yes, so that then I can have that flexibility to add new feature.

348
00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:42.150
Developer: Next, but sometimes as you don't have time in.

349
00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.880
Developer: August becomes messy.

350
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:45.720
But.

351
00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:49.530
Developer: The code is not as clean as I would have wished.

352
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:51.390
Interviewer: it's.

353
00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:52.800
Developer: What I can do for now.

354
00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:54.060
Okay.

355
00:34:56.010 --> 00:35:02.040
Interviewer: Suppose there will be another developer, who is not familiar with this project, but he.

356
00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:14.970
Interviewer: is really interested into this project and uh he wants to bring in some contribution, do you think the learning curve for this developer will be steep or maybe smooth.

357
00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.530
Developer: and difficult to tell depends a bit on the background.

358
00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:23.340
Interviewer: I can okay.

359
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:30.330
Developer: If you use to manipulating medical image and it won't be that steep.

360
00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:35.370
Developer: Okay, she know a bit about the concepts now and then.

361
00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.580
Developer: Inside the architecture.

362
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.040
Developer: At the moment, it's not.

363
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:44.280
Developer: it's not that the big project so.

364
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.780
Developer: So there's not that many complicated stuff going around.

365
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:57.360
Developer: Okay, so I I hope it's not that steep and I tried to build architecture to make it simpler.

366
00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:01.530
Interviewer: Okay gotcha so from your point of view, maybe the.

367
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:11.370
Interviewer: harder part, the more difficult part is actually the domain knowledge domain knowledge about medical imaging not to the.

368
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.070
Interviewer: Software engineering part.

369
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.900
Developer: So he said some person really.

370
00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:21.480
Interviewer: is a familiar with daikon maybe he can learn this project pretty fast.

371
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:24.810
Developer: So, yes.

372
00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:26.190
Interviewer: Okay, thanks.

373
00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:40.380
Interviewer: yeah My next question is about the understand the ability of this software can you provide some instances when users have misunderstood the software where.

374
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:51.000
Interviewer: Maybe the function, the purpose of the software, maybe misunderstood some icons or anything about the software.

375
00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:01.410
Developer: I tried to put example whenever I read your the PDF.

376
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:03.270
Developer: yeah but I.

377
00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:09.030
Developer: i'm not sure I think i'd people may be asking questions that were not really related.

378
00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:17.040
Developer: But not that many I mean from the beginning, just because the thing is called daikon so.

379
00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:22.140
Developer: yeah people will insert Okay, that is related related to medical imaging.

380
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:39.840
Developer: Then, maybe sometimes about where the thing could be integrated so maybe that could have been misunderstanding some some people asking me to if that feature could be used in in a context which.

381
00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:45.330
Developer: I had not thought of some framework.

382
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:59.850
Developer: So, for example, that is why I started the also did some integration with Google drive and people asking me to integrate and some other cloud platform.

383
00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:01.230
Developer: So.

384
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:10.110
Developer: Many whenever there is a misunderstanding sometimes it's me Okay, no not having thought about another possibility of the.

385
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.040
Interviewer: Of the software.

386
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:19.200
Developer: yeah But then when people start asking for some cloud management, which I have no idea and doesn't seem that.

387
00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:24.690
it's right.

388
00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:28.590
Interviewer: seems that there is a lag.

389
00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:38.100
Developer: Somebody to do something.

390
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:40.050
Interviewer: Interesting feature.

391
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.450
yeah.

392
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:48.480
Interviewer: yeah okay sorry there was that I go with a connection, but I heard what you said yeah.

393
00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:49.740
Developer: Okay cool.

394
00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:50.700
yeah.

395
00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:55.890
Interviewer: Sorry, I me just to get it back to the folks have a question.

396
00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:14.790
Interviewer: yeah you just mentioned that some people were asking about fat a cloud platform and this software actually i'm also very interested in cloud platform I tried to develop some a web APP or by myself hosted on aws so to think.

397
00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:24.840
Interviewer: I assume that it to be easy to host a personal version of the debate will be on maybe Amazon.

398
00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:40.440
Interviewer: aws to think so it seems that it's it's just going to be a static website, the Web be much easier than then web APP with a backend is that the case.

399
00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:53.100
Developer: I I don't know I mean people could provide it as a service and use it integrated in some cloud system.

400
00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:59.910
Developer: I don't know the idea is to support both.

401
00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.150
Developer: But then I yeah I don't have any preference right.

402
00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:08.490
Developer: Okay, I the.

403
00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:18.780
Developer: The the natural thing to integrate the The review will be in impacts system and the past being able to have some kind of plug in in which you can.

404
00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:32.520
Developer: You say okay here's my viewer can show me that that time that you are, but then having looked at the all the cloud systems seems quite the same logic be fun.

405
00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:38.250
Developer: yeah I have some data which is not in a tax but it's on the drive system, and I want.

406
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:44.850
Developer: To visualize it no so I find both interesting and I think both can be doable.

407
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:53.010
Interviewer: Okay that's true so back to the understand ability fields wv has a Google.

408
00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:54.000
Interviewer: Page you I.

409
00:40:55.830 --> 00:41:04.350
Interviewer: Did you do anything specific to improve the Anderson inability for such the icons.

410
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:05.130
Interviewer: Or maybe that.

411
00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:09.180
Interviewer: We have the software, so that users can.

412
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.260
Interviewer: understand the.

413
00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.550
Interviewer: interface batter.

414
00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:27.750
Developer: Not that much so what I did with term so then is Did it really doesn't have a gui of itself it's the client that will provide a gui to to the web yeah.

415
00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:34.650
Developer: The examples I have at the moment for i'm glad very simple so there's no real much to do there.

416
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:38.070
Developer: The the jquery one is a bit.

417
00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:39.540
more advanced.

418
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:47.520
Developer: it's clearly not that user friendly.

419
00:41:49.440 --> 00:42:00.960
Developer: But uh i've never had that many complaints about it, I guess that people adapt if ever they want to use it every day when then adapt they're going to have their own.

420
00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:19.410
Developer: And that's okay that's the main I see my work, mainly in the web and have the The examples are mainly for me to know Okay, what I would need from the Web to publish to a client and to know what API it needs.

421
00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:41.640
Developer: But then these API is I examples they're not really there for people to us directly because I guess people have other ideas about how best to to do the ui so at the moment, since i'm concentrating more on delivery V all the usability thing I leave it for clients.

422
00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:53.340
Interviewer: Okay, however, on the on the official website of the web, I think that's the github web page, I saw that there were some examples.

423
00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:56.670
Interviewer: of using the web, there were some images.

424
00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:01.230
Interviewer: When I clicked then it brought me to a.

425
00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:04.110
Interviewer: It was like an interface a gui.

426
00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:06.180
Interviewer: So, was that just an.

427
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.560
Interviewer: A simple example.

428
00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:19.410
Developer: So I think it means when I have is the examples of the web, because I wanted to show it in some context.

429
00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:22.680
Developer: and driving not just having the the.

430
00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:34.500
Developer: The idea of it, I I did add some links to the clients yeah from the web and I forgot I think they're mostly to the jquery examples, though.

431
00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:35.310
uh huh.

432
00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:40.890
Developer: Yes, and you can choose it dw mobile static or simplistic yeah.

433
00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:46.440
Developer: Maybe I should add the other ones, the angular and everything but it's.

434
00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:54.540
Developer: yeah maybe i'm not clear enough, also in the language, no, I should say Okay, the Web example model.

435
00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:55.590
Okay.

436
00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.230
Developer: yeah that would be clear and.

437
00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:07.260
Developer: But then, yes, whenever you click on an image it will bring you to the repo of the example client.

438
00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:08.760
Interviewer: Okay.

439
00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:12.360
Interviewer: So, which means for for.

440
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:16.500
Interviewer: The web it actually focus more on the.

441
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:34.440
Interviewer: Maybe the mechanism of dealing daikon but not showing that calm, so you leave this part to to your maybe your partner's your users, the other companies to finish this product, can you say that.

442
00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:42.720
Developer: Yes, I see the main responsibility of the web, to create the canvas.

443
00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:52.770
Developer: yeah the html canvas with the with the content of the medical image and then being able to send evidence and allow some control on the canvas.

444
00:44:54.540 --> 00:45:03.630
Developer: For now that's what i'm focusing on Okay, then, if people want to add burton's Okay, I want to drink window level that way or that way, do you have to do it, the way that one.

445
00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:09.900
Interviewer: Okay, thanks My next question is about to usability.

446
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:15.780
Interviewer: What if any actions were taken to address usability issues.

447
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:21.840
Developer: But not that much.

448
00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.560
Developer: But mainly the same thing, I do have people who.

449
00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:31.410
Developer: Post issues on the client examples telling me Okay, I want that button I want that thing.

450
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:46.680
Developer: And if ever they do request about Okay, the button is not good enough for some time ago, yes, I had people asking okay about some feature that didn't work, but it was because the data didn't allow it to work.

451
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:51.750
Developer: I then change and simplify that the ui on that thing but.

452
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:59.490
Developer: It yeah again again it's mostly for me to understand well what the API of the Web should be.

453
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:02.940
Interviewer: Okay, I think you.

454
00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:07.560
Interviewer: I think you mentioned that.

455
00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:10.050
Developer: Hello.

456
00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:10.620
Hello.

457
00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:19.680
Interviewer: I learned I learned the French now in in the bag.

458
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:22.740
Interviewer: of a kind of.

459
00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:27.930
Interviewer: A jazz like when we do commerce Allah.

460
00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:30.000
Interviewer: Mexico cool.

461
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.720
Mr.

462
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:50.880
Developer: To target.

463
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:55.440
Developer: Okay sorry for that.

464
00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:57.420
Interviewer: that's alright that's alright.

465
00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:02.460
Interviewer: yeah OK back to the question about usability.

466
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:16.350
Interviewer: I think we talked about it that he if you have time in the future, probably, we are going to do some usability tests so Have you already got some ideas about what kind of tests you're going to carry out.

467
00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:21.540
Developer: So maybe I mentioned it, but it's.

468
00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:27.900
Developer: it's just I experienced in companies where i've been we.

469
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:42.510
Developer: we've done some usability tests and so basically some questionnaire people rank they're feeling about the APP now yeah whatever that would have comments about that.

470
00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:52.620
Developer: And I guess, if ever I was to do some I would do it the same way questionnaire and some link on the web page Okay, give me your feedback about the thing.

471
00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:53.580
Interviewer: mm hmm.

472
00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.850
Interviewer: Can you give me just.

473
00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:00.960
Interviewer: wondering about what kind of questions you might ask.

474
00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:09.330
Developer: I thought I didn't put too much thought into it, so I don't exactly know, but like.

475
00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:11.100
Developer: I don't know.

476
00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:15.960
Developer: Do you feel like the window level tool is.

477
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:22.980
Developer: is good enough for you know, is it accessible, or you would you wish it to be accessible.

478
00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:24.690
Developer: in all contexts.

479
00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:32.700
Developer: Some questions like that, because the prior I have sometimes is about the tool that you allow on the on the data.

480
00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.850
Developer: yeah being window level room.

481
00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:41.250
Developer: or then drawing and how you switch easily between all of them.

482
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.380
Developer: yeah I think.

483
00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.210
Developer: Actually, what i'm saying i've had that.

484
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:47.430
That sounds like.

485
00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:50.970
Interviewer: We also plan to do some.

486
00:48:51.150 --> 00:49:12.900
Interviewer: usability tests not not for one software, but for all of the software in our released, we are thinking of maybe giving the users some specific tasks, asking them to use the software, for the first time, and we can how long they take to finish this test.

487
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:18.150
Interviewer: We don't have details yet just some thoughts so.

488
00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:20.970
Developer: looks good yeah.

489
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.660
Interviewer: yeah.

490
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:24.720
Interviewer: In order to test our 29 software packages.

491
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:29.400
Interviewer: Perhaps we will have to find some more general tasks.

492
00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.970
Interviewer: Most software can achieve.

493
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.650
Developer: yeah.

494
00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:38.610
Interviewer: Okay next question is about.

495
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:48.300
Interviewer: The about documentation, do you think the current documentation can clearly convey or necessary knowledge to the users.

496
00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:55.500
Interviewer: If he has ups, how does your success for your teammate if know what improvements are needed.

497
00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:03.450
Developer: we're talking about user documentation.

498
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.950
Interviewer: Yes, for users.

499
00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.720
Developer: about that.

500
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:14.670
Developer: I don't know i've got a bit on the on the jquery mobile one.

501
00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:16.650
Developer: i'm good some help button.

502
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:22.170
Developer: yeah but since i've not had that much feedback on there I don't know.

503
00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:23.970
Interviewer: Okay.

504
00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:27.780
Interviewer: yeah.

505
00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:28.710
Developer: Sorry, I guess.

506
00:50:29.310 --> 00:50:38.130
Developer: yeah I guess it's okay i've seen other tools that do show, but, for example, for the question about the the accessibility of the tools.

507
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:47.190
Developer: yeah some other tools, but some other frameworks are they show properly like what.

508
00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:50.820
Developer: mouse button, you need to use to do what action.

509
00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:57.030
Developer: And that I think is quite a nice idea on which I I don't have at the moment and so.

510
00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:16.290
Developer: When you switch to tools basically sometimes you do switch the the action of the the Left mouse button okay so being able to quickly show that to the user and tell him Okay, when you do, that the right, the left click is this that would be nice.

511
00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:24.180
Developer: So maybe that if there is an x towards usability I think that's what I would do.

512
00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:25.770
Interviewer: Okay.

513
00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:39.150
Interviewer: Sorry for that, but does dwp has a faq page maybe to have answers for those Frequently Asked Questions somewhere.

514
00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:42.990
Developer: I.

515
00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:46.830
Developer: don't think so so.

516
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:49.590
Developer: If it's not in the wiki.

517
00:51:57.930 --> 00:51:58.500
Developer: So no.

518
00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:01.830
Developer: yeah.

519
00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:13.560
Interviewer: browsing the wiki maybe yeah maybe not a day, maybe there are some answers okay look at having issues, but not on the page.

520
00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:14.460
Developer: yeah so.

521
00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:19.860
Developer: I do flow all the issues at the beginning, as questions.

522
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:25.350
Developer: And so, if ever you search in this, that would be kind of an faq.

523
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:29.250
Developer: And then I answer there.

524
00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:34.560
Developer: And I tried to put links between them, if ever they relate to the same topics.

525
00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:38.820
Developer: Okay, other so that's why i've never felt like I needed a an faq.

526
00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:52.950
Developer: The only thing, where I explained is maybe I there was a page, where I show all the arrows are I tried to show the arrows of the software, so that people know Okay, there are that kind of error it's this.

527
00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.500
Developer: But that's that's it.

528
00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:12.120
Interviewer: Okay, thanks alright our last question is about to reproducibility you have any concern that your computation no results, want to be reproducible in the future.

529
00:53:14.250 --> 00:53:19.110
Interviewer: And Have you taken any steps to ensure reproducibility.

530
00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:24.330
Developer: So is that question related to what we said before about the tests or.

531
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:26.580
Developer: Not what you mean by.

532
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:27.810
Developer: So forgery.

533
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.520
Interviewer: Computer usability.

534
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:50.940
Interviewer: For example, for this software, for the same input into kind of some outputs reproducibility means that sometime later some other people use the same software, with the same inputs, they will capture the same outputs so.

535
00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:55.620
Interviewer: Simply speaking that's reproducibility.

536
00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:04.500
Developer: Okay, understood then having good tests, is what I don't know who ensure reproducibility yes.

537
00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:06.690
Developer: Okay.

538
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:19.290
Developer: Maybe I don't have enough so, for example, one of the outputs of dw will be some kind of quantification of the values of the pixels that are below a shape that you've drawn.

539
00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:20.070
yeah.

540
00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:27.450
Developer: I don't know, I know, so the tests are mainly unit test.

541
00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:29.220
Developer: So they try to.

542
00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.760
Developer: test the functions that are available into degree.

543
00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:36.270
Developer: I don't have any user interaction tests.

544
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:43.560
Developer: Okay that's that's about I would wish to maybe improve so some of the framework to provide you.

545
00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:49.800
Developer: ways to simulate the the component and then interact really with it.

546
00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:54.540
Developer: Okay, and that's something I will need to do in the future.

547
00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:57.210
Developer: Okay, so be sure, like okay.

548
00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:01.890
Developer: simulate really the drawing of a rectangle and see the.

549
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:07.350
Developer: output, the values that are given and be sure that it's always the same.

550
00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.890
Interviewer: Okay, so interaction tests.

551
00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:14.310
Interviewer: Are they, the same as integration tests.

552
00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:17.100
Interviewer: So testing those.

553
00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:20.430
Developer: kind of.

554
00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:26.490
Developer: interactions would be okay, the one of the highest level, you can go.

555
00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:27.450
Okay.

556
00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:42.330
Developer: I mean you could have one step below something that just stays in the component and maybe tries to do some actions and called some API of the web.

557
00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:45.660
Developer: And then that will be more inter integration.

558
00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:46.530
Okay.

559
00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:55.110
Developer: But it's the the interaction for the one from above, where I really want to simulate a mouse click.

560
00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:56.880
Developer: yeah and see the result.
