Developer: We do also some analysis i've developed some tools in this domain and then, when I finished my PhD it was also it was a scientific PhD but also or.

20
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.010
Developer: We call that into interdisciplinary.

21
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:59.430

37
00:03:48.690 --> 00:04:06.660
Interviewer: Okay, so did you mean that you started the project in 2010 okay yeah that's actually our next question so starting from 2010 and I suppose it was open source, from the very beginning and I right.

38
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.670

41
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:37.140

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.270
Interviewer: I think.

49
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.840
Interviewer: yeah I think open source is becoming more and more popular.

50
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.950
Developer: Now yeah sure.

51
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:10.950
Interviewer: yeah a follow up question is about the place you're holding your project I forgot to, that is, with his code.

52
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.120
Interviewer: On github.

53
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.220

Interviewer: So did you hosted on github from the beginning.

57
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.200
Developer: No, because.

58
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.830
Developer: It was maybe at the beginning of.

59
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.980
Developer: Yes, I don't remember.

60
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.050
Developer: Maybe I when I started the project, the github wasn't exists.

61
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.890
Interviewer: Oh yeah.

62
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.380
Interviewer: yeah.

63
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.230
Developer: We move we move to get quite a long time ago, yes.

64
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.750
Interviewer: Okay, I talked with some other developers I think most of them.

65
00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:02.100
Interviewer: Their projects are also on github and now, some of them told me that they were using source forge or maybe bit back hit.

66
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.330
Interviewer: Yes, it.

67
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:10.470

68
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.090
Interviewer: binary pick okay.

69
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.990
I cages.

70
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:34.350
Developer: But maybe I will stop to do it, because now in github we build automatically release and we have also a website for documentation and I will just maybe let download from this side, the package so maybe I will change that.

71
00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:43.200
Interviewer: Okay next question is about your team how large is the development group, how many others are working with you.

72
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.540
Developer: there's two or three developer, we are small team.

73
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:50.610
Interviewer: Okay, so.

74
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.700
Interviewer: These two or three I suppose.

75
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.820
Interviewer: You don't mean the contributions from github the pull request right.

76
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:10.440
Developer: Yes, I mean yes in our hospital, but there is some contributor on github I think there are very few and.

77
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.850
Developer: There are some company.

78
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.710
Developer: or some they participate.

79
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:27.180
Developer: Several company in Brazil, the but also to help to fix bug or or some feature even.

80
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.110
Developer: Some features.

81
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.840
Developer: But yes.

82
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:38.850
Developer: But it's not very often to to have contribution, I would say, major contribution.

83
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.120
Interviewer: Okay yeah it's good to know.

84
00:07:43.200 --> 00:08:02.520
Interviewer: I actually I just interviewed a group of developers in Brazil, I think they are the developers of in serious sorry I forgot the name, but I can see that there are some active communities in this domain in Brazil.

85
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:03.780
yeah.

86
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.720
Interviewer: All right next question is.

87
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:14.100
Interviewer: How do you accept contributions to your team and to a project.

88
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:30.060
Developer: I don't try every some restriction, but now we try to use a pull request on github because I think, is the best process to to contribute, because you asked for the contribution.

89
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.860
Developer: And also, we have.

90
00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.480
automatically.

91
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.290
Developer: rerun of Santa cloud.

92
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.980
Developer: And when you you push the poor recap.

93
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:57.180
Developer: pull request you will give the quality direct directly your quality of your code and it's good to know for contributor is there is some bug or two to do directly this information.

94
00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.850
Interviewer: yeah I remember that.

95
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.990
Interviewer: I had a I had an internship in Canada.

96
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:12.810
Interviewer: In that company, I remember that we also use the sonar cube I think that's one part of the devops process.

97
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:20.010
Interviewer: So besides our sooner cube to have any other tools for ci CD.

98
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.560
Developer: We use now the older tools in github.

99
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:38.010
Developer: Because it is very impressive what you can do with github action and i've done since last year i've done many script for that and.

100
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:52.440
Developer: There is now a big part for building for ci for release note for different think they are now fully automatic receipt of X action.

101
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:57.180
Interviewer: That has amazing Thank you i've never tried to get her action, but I.

126
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:22.650

127
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:48.060
Interviewer: They develop tools for themselves, secondly, is software engineers, so they are not domain experts, but they work in the domain, the 30s experts in imaging so such as your previous background, so I assume that he knew your team, you have all of those three types of backgrounds, am I right.

128
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:49.650

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.650
Interviewer: As a very hard.

149
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:30.930
Developer: Yes, I, yes, but I would interest to have an ID but I know for, for instance, because.

150
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:43.770
Developer: I know there are some people, they are building quizzes on their own, and they are also in the India in the hospital and they distribute after the software in the.

151
00:14:44.580 --> 00:15:02.160
Developer: hospitals, I know, for instance, I just have a conversation with a guy in Turkey, and they say we use whizzes, but this is a health network, and they are more than 60.

152
00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:15.960
Developer: hospital in this next next network, so I guess at the end, there is a lot of user, because only in our hospital, we have some profile for users.

153
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:18.540
Developer: in business, and we know.

154
00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:28.920
Developer: For many years, but we have more about 10,000 profiles, so we know there are 10,000 people they have open with this one day.

155
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.120
Developer: Okay, but.

156
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:37.290
Developer: But it doesn't mean anything to because when you, you ask user.

157
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:45.930
Developer: Maybe we have maybe to know if there is a user only one time or is your.

158
00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:59.430
Developer: User freakin more frequent user the software as a different type of user so also maybe diff difficult tourists to once the question.

159
00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.670
Developer: is maybe two to general.

160
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:13.980
Interviewer: yeah that's that's totally all right, I think you already provide a lot of decals to us and yeah I, I know that this question can be hard it has, I think.

161
00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:21.930
Interviewer: So next question is still about their users, what is the typical background of a user.

162
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.560
Developer: Some not yes.

163
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:46.890
Developer: General zod medical doctors Oh, I see mostly they're also originally just in I saw in some country, for instance i've been in Africa and not for for for that not for business, but I made some ridges and we use your software.

164
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:55.170
Developer: What normally, they should not use this software, because we are not certified for diagnostic.

165
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.620
Developer: yeah and but the useful diagnostic.

166
00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:06.240
Developer: So I would say not normally is the radiologists will not use with this, but I know it's awesome.

167
00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:19.590
Developer: Because we are not satisfied for the diagnostic how that also, I would say, researchers, there are a lot of research that use medical image.

168
00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:28.950
Developer: And also patient, because there are some company or so the distribute whizzes in daikon CD.

169
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.890
Developer: Maybe CDs not so popular.

170
00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:47.430
Developer: cnet bezel all still some some in our our speaker, we still give some CD but not a lot, but some people want to have a CD when they do a scanner or and.

171
00:17:48.330 --> 00:18:04.710
Developer: So with this, you also can read directly, they can see, because it is a standard, and it is a records that they can dear and it's a special a structure to put.

172
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:08.940
Developer: A dichotomy image on.

173
00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.550
Developer: Media or like a CD or or USB key.

174
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:17.130
Interviewer: Okay, thanks.

175
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:29.250
Interviewer: next question is about you, your current obstacles, currently, what are the most significant obstacles in your development process.

176
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:37.530
Developer: I put I would say the most difficult is the time I can.

177
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:42.900
Developer: deliver for for that, because that's three clear, because I have a lot of solicitation.

178
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.630
Developer: And I cannot respond now and.

179
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:56.400
Developer: i've i've in charge of a lot of thing in our city, I have all already a very busy day and it's very difficult to me to respond.

180
00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:06.840
Developer: about all the all the things I get so that's the time I can I can give for that.

181
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.340
Interviewer: Okay.

182
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:19.230
Interviewer: suppose that even if there were more fundings do you think that can be solved this problem.

183
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.140
Developer: Maybe not because.

184
00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:28.470
Developer: My program is not to get money but it's good to get time.

185
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.150
Interviewer: yeah.

186
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:50.700
Developer: Maybe I can also delegate some development if I have money and we can hire a developer sure, but I would say now it's it's time I can because to supervise the projects, you know came and.

187
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.800
Developer: You can.

188
00:19:55.350 --> 00:20:07.080
Developer: If you receive some contribution that you always have to to to help the people to maybe to structure more.

189
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.150
Developer: New way to be consistent.

190
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.980
Developer: With the software engineer right.

191
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.670
Interviewer: yeah.

192
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:17.430
Developer: it's difficult to just contribute, I would say, for for this kind of software.

193
00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:19.650
Interviewer: yeah gotcha.

194
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:34.770
Interviewer: So a category is is the likeness of 10 from a higher level it from a super supervisor level, not only from the developers now yes.

195
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:44.550
Developer: Yes, because because he is, if you are, if you want to have a good product, you have to be consistent and to.

196
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.260
Developer: Yes.

197
00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.300
Developer: to drive it.

198
00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.500
Interviewer: yeah, however.

199
00:20:52.290 --> 00:21:00.090
Interviewer: Another question about obstacles is that I heard some developers complaining about.

200
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:08.520
Interviewer: The access to medical images, some of them told me that they don't have enough access to medical images.

201
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:12.510
Interviewer: because those are privacy patients.

202
00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.300
Interviewer: Yes, sometimes it's hard for them yeah.

203
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:18.720
Developer: Yes, our so developing a new software.

204
00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.150
Developer: For an open source software.

205
00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.540
Developer: For this unification of the image.

206
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.420
Developer: To create the bridge with the clinical.

207
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:42.180
Developer: and researchers and I know very well, as these questions and I understand a lot of companies, they want to have more data, but the problem is data is belonging to patient.

208
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.550
Developer: So so it's not easy to get something data yes.

209
00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:48.840
Okay.

210
00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:58.230
Interviewer: For those for those two two problems we talked about have you got any like solutions for them.

211
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:02.280
Interviewer: In the future, how.

212
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.200
Interviewer: Can your development process to to tackle these problems.

213
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:24.090
Developer: I don't I don't really have a solution, I try to be more efficient, when I sometimes before I was always answer for question or for.

214
00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:40.650
Developer: For different issue question I get for the for the software, but now, sometimes I I don't have time to when it's not so relevant I will sometimes I don't respond.

215
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.880
Developer: Okay, but I have to to make a choice.

216
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:51.570
Developer: Yes, if i'm not enough time so sometimes I fished a some question.

217
00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:53.430
Interviewer: Okay.

218
00:22:55.140 --> 00:23:11.760
Interviewer: So for those questions, is there any way to maybe make a faq for those questions are these questions or frequently asked is there a way to maybe a document those answers, so you can save some time.

219
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:19.260
Developer: Yes, maybe, maybe, yes, if you want, I can just show you the documentation website.

220
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.070
Interviewer: sure.

221
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.470
Developer: It could be interesting to understand.

222
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.920
Developer: I would share my.

223
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:34.230
Developer: I thought was I thought we was about on teams, but we are on zoom.

224
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.250
Interviewer: Yes, yeah.

225
00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:38.880

Developer: Yet that's Okay, no.

228
00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:54.060
Developer: So there is a website is Austin github.

229
00:23:55.500 --> 00:24:04.230
Developer: documentation website and something could be interesting or see for us this website can be.

230
00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:18.000
Developer: It is automatically generated just a static website and to you can, if you get if you go on a page, you can propose a pull request, also in the.

231
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.230
Interviewer: Past okay.

232
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.580
Because.

233
00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:41.760
Developer: Because, you have the the main page or do a markdown so you can pop some people have already do that to propose a pull request to to modify the documentation so.

234
00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:43.620
Okay well.

235
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.890
Interviewer: I suppose yeah yeah.

236
00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:48.330
Interviewer: Go ahead.

237
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:50.700
Developer: No, I just.

238
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.700
Developer: Your question was about.

239
00:24:54.390 --> 00:25:05.670
Interviewer: That documentation, maybe yeah to to save your attack yeah so for this documentation, I assume that they are for users right how to.

240
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.890
Interviewer: And how is that software.

241
00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:09.840
Developer: If is phobos.

242
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:10.920
Interviewer: You can find a for.

243
00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.180
Developer: instance, you can find.

244
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:21.750
Developer: out to to install with popular system packs system like this in 40 or or.

245
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:27.420
Developer: And then also information for developer or okay.

246
00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.070
Developer: With this.

247
00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:39.120
Developer: For international internationalization or you can translate we are about 2020 language.

248
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:42.060
Developer: translation.

249
00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.930
Developer: Some guideline for for developer.

250
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:52.590
Developer: yeah how to configure the tools, but after we are also some tutorials.

251
00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:58.590
Developer: for users, how to use, for instance out to use the zoom.

252
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.060
software.

253
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:06.330
Developer: I know I know that there's a lot of.

254
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.490
Developer: missing.

255
00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:21.120
Developer: As always in the recommendation, but we have already some some of the main things are made in the documentation.

256
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.300
Developer: For for understanding how to install it.

257
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:29.700
Developer: What is the architecture of the software.

258
00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:36.270
Developer: I think I think we have documentation, because some software don't have.

259
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:38.160
Developer: documentation.

260
00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.200
Developer: yeah we basis.

261
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:41.160
yeah.

262
00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:53.520
Interviewer: yeah actually we we are at our you haven't question is about the documentation, you know, since with is already have termination for users and developers.

263
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:55.830
Interviewer: i'm curious about the.

264
00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:07.920
Interviewer: Efficiency of documentation to developers, do you think this this party is working, do you think documentation to developers actually favorably or tan.

265
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:15.930
Developer: Yes, I, I know that, because we have also a forum and Google form.

266
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:16.860
Developer: Has a.

267
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:36.750
Developer: lot of question about out to compile out to insta or or and always I made reference directly in the documentation and I know that there is a lot of papers that readings is documentation the.

268
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:44.790
Developer: Asking for for Wednesday so mistake, I know, in general, I know they use it.

269
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:56.820
Interviewer: Okay, thanks, but it's deal as the main architect, the main developer, and the supervisor of this project yesterday oh don't have enough time.

270
00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:05.640
Interviewer: Maybe perfect here you have time for the project do think improving documentation, we are help with this situation in the future.

271
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:15.630
Developer: Yes, sure this is, this is the reasons I tried to to do some documentation, because without documentation.

272
00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:35.250
Developer: it's not possible for for contributors, for instance, for people who want to to add fixing bugs or things like that they need to have the minimum documentation for installing for understanding how to run and some here.

273
00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:37.560
Developer: I think it is.

274
00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:39.840
Developer: It is really.

275
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:42.870
Developer: Mandatory to have.

276
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:44.940
Developer: This documentation.

277
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.230
Interviewer: Okay, thanks.

278
00:28:47.610 --> 00:29:03.270
Interviewer: Our next question is going to be the problems already happened and solving the in the past, so in the past, is there any major obstacle to your development process that has been solved and how did you solve it.

279
00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:12.420
Developer: Yes, it's just one to remember, if I write something about that i'm.

280
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:29.580
Developer: I think that is the main.

281
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:33.390
Developer: Difficulties would be.

282
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:49.320
Developer: To to to to have maybe more time to respond for for users or for for developers, it is to to have some.

283
00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:57.150
Developer: customization on github I talked before about github action.

284
00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:05.370
Developer: And, last year I do a lot of things with that to automatically build the software.

285
00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:20.070
Developer: Okay, because it's quite it's quite up to to build it because we we now build it on different platform, so we use github there is a is free for for.

286
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:22.740
Developer: For open source software to.

287
00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:28.440
Developer: build on MAC on Linux and windows, so we build it automatically.

288
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.810
Developer: From the source code so so now.

289
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:40.950
Developer: When I do really is also make maybe I can show you.

290
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.320
Developer: really is not if I take.

291
00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:48.360
Developer: The kids.

292
00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:54.480
Developer: and find the quizzes.

293
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:59.550
Developer: We we build the change log automatically or so.

294
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.880
Developer: Okay, we see github issues.

295
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:09.930
Developer: So when when it build automatically you will add, for instance, last week, it is yeah.

296
00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:13.140
Developer: it's a date and all the.

297
00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.270
Developer: All the fix.

298
00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:31.290
Developer: You you do automatically, so I think it's a good thing, because I see all sometimes some software they don't have really is not, and I think it's very difficult to manage your software, if you don't have that.

299
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:32.970
Developer: yeah so.

300
00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:45.090
Interviewer: yeah sorry I didn't notice there's ever been here before by dinners I think it is easy very good feature, I think this is a very good changer on your linkedin issues to.

301
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:45.720
Interviewer: enjoy.

302
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:53.430
Developer: It is automatically, I do not do anything adjust adjust manage issues.

303
00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:58.380
Developer: Okay yeah and I put a put lab in here.

304
00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:14.070
Developer: And this is a bug I just check it is a bug and then it comes automatically when I close the issues you he will he will he will go directly in the in the release note when I believe.

305
00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:19.290
Interviewer: yeah this is interesting, I have some personal projects and i'm going to try this.

306
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:21.210
Interviewer: Thank you for sharing.

307
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:26.280
Developer: This is, it is an open source project that builder that's.

308
00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:30.810
Developer: Okay geez I don't remember the name of this project.

309
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:33.090
Interviewer: yeah I didn't go ahead and maybe search thanks.

310
00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.900
Interviewer: Alright next question is about your software development model.

311
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.320
Interviewer: What is your software development model.

312
00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:48.840
Interviewer: For example, to use waterfall or maybe as your team user jail.

313
00:32:51.360 --> 00:33:02.700
Developer: I would say, but we don't have really a we don't strictly follow method, but I would say it's more water for yeah.

314
00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:03.480
Okay.

315
00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:07.410
Interviewer: So, so now I.

316
00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:20.190
Interviewer: Currently, if if some users one one some new features, can they send a request to you like if they request some new features.

317
00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:26.040
Interviewer: Today, maybe send your emails or maybe post to family issues on github.

318
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:36.510
Developer: yeah so as issues, I would say on forums there's some question or issue they'll create.

319
00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:38.580
Developer: The keto.

320
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:44.730
Interviewer: Okay, and after receiving these requests, how to deal with this.

321
00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:51.810
Interviewer: request to the features, if you decided some features, maybe we can add in the future, how to.

322
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:53.220
features.

323
00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:03.210
Developer: Sometimes it depends, which feature is I always also response to.

324
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:17.640
Developer: Some people, I will I would add some feature if there is an interest for for a lot of people because I don't want to build a feature on the specific to context or.

325
00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:22.860
Developer: or specific for for sure user and.

326
00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:27.780
Developer: but also how I say that.

327
00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:31.980
Developer: Unfortunately, I know it's time to.

328
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:37.830
Developer: To to take the request, because I have already a big to do list.

329
00:34:38.970 --> 00:34:40.920
Developer: And that's the problem.

330
00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:42.750
Interviewer: yeah gotcha.

331
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:54.060
Interviewer: Okay next question is about the project management process yeah So what is this management process, and if there is no specific.

332
00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.290
Interviewer: project management process Maybe you can talk about how you make plans.

333
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.930
Interviewer: For your next releases.

334
00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:02.910
Developer: Yes.

335
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:09.930
Developer: I think squared simple I just I have some Google Doc pages.

336
00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:15.210
Developer: And some yes to do this and.

337
00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:42.720
Developer: So some documentation private documentation or for specific implementation, I tried to get documentation for, for that is quite simple I don't want us as we do in a in an hour Spiteri when we develop tools we use things like jira or or or the.

338
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:56.070
Developer: tools, but for whizzes as we are small community I just use and share some Google docs and I think it's enough for them.

339
00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:10.350
Interviewer: Okay, good Do you see any opportunity to improve your efficiency or maybe save your time by improve this process supposedly there is further space for improving.

340
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.460
Developer: What wait, what do you mean.

341
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:19.380
Interviewer: A dude new thing that.

342
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:27.000
Interviewer: Maybe in the question for TIM is actually do you think improving this process.

343
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.340
Interviewer: and tackle the current problem.

344
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.220
Developer: Yes.

345
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.810
Developer: yeah yes sure.

346
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:35.760
Developer: But.

347
00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.540
Developer: Yes, lily this.

348
00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:49.530
Developer: Improvement you mean for for the team if they are more.

349
00:36:52.830 --> 00:37:12.000
Developer: structure process that can help, but I say we are a small community so maybe just by email or by basic tools, I think it's enough, so I understand for open source project that when there is some.

350
00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:24.930
Developer: Wednesday are many people, it becomes very difficult to to organize and to to manage the leader of the project, so we are not in this case.

351
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:26.760
Interviewer: Okay okay gotcha.

352
00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.070
Interviewer: Thanks.

353
00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:51.360
Interviewer: Alright, our next question is about to the correctness of the software so was it harder to ensure that trainees over the software and if there were any obstacles what mathers have been considered or practice to improve the situation if practice it work.

354
00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:54.960
Developer: Yes.

355
00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:59.520
Developer: But it it's I would say.

356
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:09.360
Developer: The we first we try to follow the the standout daikon stand out because he is really.

357
00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:16.860
Developer: Important because as As you may know, maybe the day Konstantinos is very large and.

358
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.600
Developer: There isn't.

359
00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:23.730
Developer: I don't know, maybe some 10,000 pages and it's crazy maybe.

360
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:32.370
Developer: I am I do some implementation directly from the Sunda so.

361
00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:48.300
Developer: We try to make with this as a day can view a really based on the day comes standard, so I also refuse to implement things they are in the opposite direction of the Center.

362
00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:50.910
Developer: Okay, because some people asked me for that.

363
00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:58.440
Developer: Okay, so I would say it's important to to understand that, because.

364
00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:04.110
Developer: The correctness is is about.

365
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.270
Developer: To be aligned with where is the standard so.

366
00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:14.850
Developer: there's also a big problem I face is.

367
00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:25.050
Developer: As you may know, in in medical imaging you have a rendering and if you do some some diagnostic.

368
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:32.190
Developer: You have you need to have some contrast on the image and.

369
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:42.300
Developer: I know there is a many commercial view of the don't display the right value of the pixel because it's very complex.

370
00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.880
Developer: There is a lot of.

371
00:39:46.470 --> 00:40:06.720
Developer: a chain of lookup table you a different level, you have a presentation lookup table modality lookup table it's very difficult to understand all the standout and I know there is many commercial view or they don't do really strictly as a standard.

372
00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:17.220
Developer: Okay, and we try to do that as so we have a lot of user and I saw also in the forums, they say.

373
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:30.180
Developer: Sometimes they can read correctly an image with once have I always respond for that and try to to correct if there is some issue but.

374
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:41.460
Developer: Maybe I have another advantage, because now about more than 10 years I collect also all the specific image.

375
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:53.100
Developer: People send me or also have a problem in our speaker because we use or See also intensively in in the hospital the software so.

376
00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:55.920
Developer: yeah I have a lot of.

377
00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.930
Developer: Very sometimes specific samples.

378
00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:14.340
Developer: Also, with mistakes, there are some image that they are produced by some some equipments they are not correct or something.

379
00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:15.870
Interviewer: yeah.

380
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:16.860
But.

381
00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:36.660
Developer: I would say the difficulty to have the good rendering it's it's not easy to make simple test like a unit test, and so I now I tried to to make the tool with the open CV library.

382
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:37.200
Interviewer: It says.

383
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:42.390
Developer: The image processing your library I find something that is very useful.

384
00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:44.340
Developer: To.

385
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:48.840
Developer: to compare the image with.

386
00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.420
Developer: statistic approach.

387
00:41:52.650 --> 00:42:00.150
Developer: And it's very interesting because in our software, we can, maybe you're the compressed or compressed image.

388
00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.820
Developer: And we want to check.

389
00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:07.890
Developer: If it is the same image, but maybe with some degradation or.

390
00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:35.040
Developer: compress compression and now with this function, I can merge measure that and I try to to to make test in the software to guarantee the good rendering for specific image for very difficult situation when there is a defined lookup table level.

391
00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:48.450
Developer: and try to to have some tests for for for for ensuring to have not regression on this on this part because.

392
00:42:50.040 --> 00:43:02.850
Developer: This part in the card is very complex and when you change something it's very challenging to to say no it's Okay, we can do that.

393
00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:17.460
Interviewer: yeah yeah it's really interesting interesting to know, thank you for answering that and I think you are right, some some develop development groups mentioned that they do have enough.

394
00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:24.630
Interviewer: test data they don't have enough sample data so sometimes it's harder for them to finish their testing it.

395
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:29.790
Interviewer: Sure yeah and I also heard that some manufacturers.

396
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:34.950
Interviewer: With the equipment, we sometimes change their standards of.

397
00:43:34.980 --> 00:43:36.060
Interviewer: Their icon.

398
00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:38.280
Interviewer: was actually some problem for you.

399
00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.110
Developer: Yes.

400
00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:56.250
Developer: But in the day come stand out there are some sometimes they are some some part of snow down not use or never i've been using that, no, no, no supplier implemented.

401
00:43:56.670 --> 00:44:05.670
Developer: Okay, sometimes, yes, you have some and and also sometimes a standardized very weird.

402
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:10.080
Developer: Because, for instance, you can have.

403
00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:13.530
Developer: rgb model.

404
00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:21.930
Developer: And in a in a compressed in a major, which is a compressed.

405
00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:27.780
Developer: And so it's not meaningful, but it is possible on this thunder so.

406
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:34.050
Developer: Okay, sometimes sometimes you are very strange cases.

407
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:37.740
Interviewer: Okay gotcha.

408
00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:47.040
Interviewer: My next question is about maintain ability our software yeah so when designing the SOFA where did you consider.

409
00:44:47.520 --> 00:45:03.000
Interviewer: The use of future change, for example, we actually be hard to change the structure of the system modules or kota blocks, so any measures have been taken to ensure the gives our future changed and maintain it.

410
00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:17.250
Developer: I think one aspect, maybe i'm quite confident with certain maybe I can maybe show you it.

411
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:18.660
Developer: Sure anymore easy.

412
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:22.230
Developer: It is on the documentation so i'll.

413
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:27.180
Developer: Get back to the documentation.

414
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:30.510
Developer: Here you should have.

415
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:39.810
Developer: something about with this architecture and to explain we use with GI I don't know if you know that.

416
00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:40.410
Interviewer: Now, and.

417
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:52.080
Developer: It is a concession on the top of the Java Java platform to to have modularity on Java and.

418
00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:56.460
Developer: it's very smart and it is used on.

419
00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:03.330
Developer: Different or so a caveman in a poison, for instance in cars or.

420
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:04.950
Developer: Okay, different.

421
00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:07.080
Developer: Is it is.

422
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:15.810
Developer: It is very interesting, it is us, or so in in bigger and bigger server he also finds us eclipse.

423
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:23.160
Developer: tools attempts to use it or or J bus or many server or use also a GI.

424
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:29.430
Developer: Okay, it is a very interesting, and so we can do what we can do to to have.

425
00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.220
Developer: A system.

426
00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.620
Developer: modular system.

427
00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.950
Developer: Okay, do you have to respect that.

428
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:45.960
Developer: So we build with this with with different layers of plugins and.

429
00:46:47.070 --> 00:47:00.990
Developer: There is a core part and then you have a path for Codex, for instance there, and you have a path for exploring the data and you have about it is a yes, the aggregate agree at all.

430
00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:02.130
Developer: For the ui.

431
00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:09.630
Developer: And after you have different type of plugin for visualization you have a day can do.

432
00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:14.670
Developer: But you our so for for for different.

433
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:29.640
Developer: types of that data, you can have different views so when when, for instance, when we have developed, two years ago, a viewer for for.

434
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:42.570
Developer: image for the Rachel oncology image, it is very specific, so it says very few you are that can display this kind of image and.

435
00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:52.560
Developer: We develop it but it's really a plugins so we can activate it or this activate and we don't mix the card.

436
00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:57.990
Developer: So the way to develop we.

437
00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.480
Developer: I think, give.

438
00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:07.980
Developer: give it more, it is more easy to maintain the software, when you do.

439
00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:11.190
Developer: In this way.

440
00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:13.950
Interviewer: yeah data.

441
00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.770
Developer: I don't know if it makes sense for you.

442
00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:30.930
Interviewer: yeah that makes sense, I am i'm very familiar with Java, but i'm not familiar with the framework part about it, but I continue later yeah yeah great thanks My next question is about.

443
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:53.940
Interviewer: Their they understand ability over the software, so can you provide an instance where users have misunderstood the software, for example, maybe in some cases, the user can misunderstand the purpose of your software more maybe or maybe some functions some icons.

444
00:48:55.740 --> 00:49:00.120
Interviewer: Some patterns anything other software can you provide some instances.

445
00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:03.240
Developer: Yes.

446
00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:13.830
Developer: That sometimes there is question on the Forum, the because it's not easy to understand for maybe newbies or.

447
00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:20.460
Developer: Some people they they asked all to integrate the icon software or their computer.

448
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:24.150
Developer: And there is several way to do it.

449
00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:30.360
Developer: So some sometimes they missed on the stand.

450
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:40.620
Developer: The way because also make I would say, maybe we use before Java web stuff, which is a way to.

451
00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:46.680
Developer: To do to launch in Java application with.

452
00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:57.450
Developer: The web context, and now we have changed that because, because the shower stuff has been removed from Java 11.

453
00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:59.580
Developer: Okay, and.

454
00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:02.970
Developer: We use more.

455
00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:20.070
Developer: Common way to do that, so we can use, we can launch with this in the Web context we say your I, like other application like Microsoft, for instance, you can lounge with a specific ui we use it.

456
00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:23.610
Developer: We call that whizzes.

457
00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:51.600
Developer: slash slash after you put the URL so so we have changed that and sometimes and the user don't understand because this the the the read it is can be launched in the Web context, so they understand it is a web application and they don't understand sometimes.

458
00:50:52.440 --> 00:51:03.630
Developer: How to use it out to integrate software, but I guess it's additional but sometimes it happens because it's quite confusing.

459
00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:08.280
Interviewer: So uh has had have there been any actions.

460
00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:11.400
Interviewer: taken to address this issue.

461
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:20.850
Developer: Yes, I publish very big when I we move to the new version I published in the forum very long explanation.

462
00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:24.000
Developer: Okay, well, the purpose to why we do that.

463
00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:26.970
Developer: Because that was a very input time to change because.

464
00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:54.030
Developer: Oracle remove this function of our staff and we we won't survive if we don't change it so so so I put a very long explanation to to explain why we do that, and also our to use it in the future and to also to show that is more powerful.

465
00:51:56.250 --> 00:52:10.500
Developer: way to us if we change, but you have to explain that, because if you don't explain us say a lot of things and they don't understand there's a big confusion, but.

466
00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:19.170
Developer: I think it was it was helpful because I think a lot of people read it, and maybe they understand better after.

467
00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:21.270
Interviewer: Sure, Patrick.

468
00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:26.550
Interviewer: My next question is about the usability of the software.

469
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:28.140
Interviewer: So.

470
00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:39.420
Interviewer: What if any actions were taken to address usability issues have you done anything to make software easier to use.

471
00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:45.090
Developer: Yes, yes, we tried to do that, because we know.

472
00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:51.810
Developer: I know very well that's at medical doctors don't have any time to read the competition just.

473
00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:54.690
Developer: whisper to ask them for that just.

474
00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:55.500
Developer: Forget it.

475
00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:57.780
Developer: And so.

476
00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:01.740
Developer: You, you have to provide software, you can use it.

477
00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:20.370
Developer: it's you should have you to be economic and to be a yes and we try to do that and it, I think, also it is we improve or so that, from the user feedback or so.

478
00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:22.320
Developer: Okay, year after year.

479
00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:31.320
Developer: Okay, so I guess you can launch with this and understand for people no medical imaging.

480
00:53:32.250 --> 00:53:54.540
Developer: out to use it without reading documentation, but after a while you can go into tutorials and read the some specific documentation out to use more advanced features and stuff like that, but I think you for just basic usage you don't you don't need documentation.

481
00:53:55.500 --> 00:54:00.570
Interviewer: Okay, so just intuitively a user can use it.

482
00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:01.500
Interviewer: is good.

483
00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:05.400
Developer: But you have to do that, I am serious because.

484
00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:14.040
Developer: There is a medical doctor the cons and they have a lot of things to to do and.

485
00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:22.170
Developer: They can they can be trained or very fastly so that's that's really the reality.

486
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:30.090
Interviewer: Okay yeah thanks our next question is part of the documentation, you mentioned that some.

487
00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:49.920
Interviewer: details of how to use the software is in the documentation, do you think that the current documentation can clearly convey or necessary knowledge to the users If yes, how did you successfully achieve it even know what improvements, do you think are needed.

488
00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:58.590
Developer: um.

489
00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:01.260
Developer: I think.

490
00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:08.340
Developer: I think the documentation is a good start, as I said before, and.

491
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:24.540
Developer: I always we can we can add more thing in recommendation, but the problem is also time so so we I tried to do my best to have or maybe the the key things.

492
00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:33.540
Developer: In the documentation, because if you put too many dead details in the documentation, you have to maintain also.

493
00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:34.470
Yes, yes.

494
00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:36.900
Interviewer: yeah.

495
00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:39.300
Developer: that's the problem.

496
00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:40.650
yeah.

497
00:55:43.470 --> 00:56:04.530
Interviewer: I could be the side of the website, or we face, I also consider maybe get heavy issues and the for around as documentation so some people when they search the problems they may find answers actually in could have issues or may be in the forums, which are answered the other people previous.

498
00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:10.560
Developer: Yes, also we put a fact, but.

499
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:23.820
Developer: There is not a lot of thing on it, but we try to put also a template on github to to to remember something about user.

500
00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:28.410
Developer: Not as question issue to use the forum and.

501
00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:33.600
Developer: always to have to repeat that but yes.

502
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:37.560
Developer: yeah yeah it's not easy, some things.

503
00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:43.410
Interviewer: No that's not a huge, especially for for users who are developers themselves.

504
00:56:43.800 --> 00:57:03.060
Developer: Yes, there is sometimes people are very accurate and that's the reason we put template when you create an issue, normally, you have to put the version of Java, the differences, I put different points to to fill to failure that.

505
00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.910
Developer: That matters but.

506
00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:11.370
Developer: people's often done don't do that, unfortunately.

507
00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:20.100
Developer: They asked question without without giving the context I just respond is impossible to me to respond.

508
00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:41.910
Developer: About that if you don't give out to you our because there is so many way to integrate with this, there are different distributions says many a way to us so if you don't give information it's not possible to to give a good answer.

509
00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:43.830
Interviewer: yeah I agree, I agree.

510
00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:47.490
Interviewer: And this this equation actually happens everywhere.

511
00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:51.630
Interviewer: I visit a lot of github repos.

512
00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:55.320
Interviewer: And in their issues, I can see that the developers.

513
00:57:56.520 --> 00:58:03.600
Interviewer: From time to time, always reply that please least three or issues in the correct contact context, so we.

514
00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:11.490
Developer: Yes, I see some people they do really good things, but.

515
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:22.470
Developer: I would say, also in the forums, a zero always also people they take the opportunity to ask a new question in the inverter peak.

516
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:36.600
Developer: As we didn't we didn't yet answer the question but they ask a new question and that's you can follow the topic is people do that, so I also say no, please, create a new topic.

517
00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:42.420
Interviewer: yeah I yeah I mean customer service is a big department.

518
00:58:44.490 --> 00:58:50.130
Interviewer: So, especially for open source projects it's very hard to keep up curricula users koshetz.

519
00:58:51.720 --> 00:59:09.810
Interviewer: Okay, then my final question the last one is about hero, the reproducibility of the software, do you have any concern that your computational results, want to be reproducible in the future and Have you taken any steps to ensure reproducibility.

520
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:16.650
Developer: When when you talk about reproducibility what exactly you mean.

521
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:24.030
Developer: To be sure that the software will produce the same thing in the future, or the same results.

522
00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:33.870
Interviewer: yeah that that's correct, we are talking about the the output from the Center where we are that be consistent.

523
00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:36.900
Developer: yeah I would say, I said before.

524
00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:45.840
Developer: Most important, in the deck of viewer it is to have the good rendering of the image.

525
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:49.320
Developer: So this is what i'd say before I.

526
00:59:50.250 --> 01:00:10.650
Developer: For many years, I tried to to have the test for that now I start to have something I would be more confident to to to keep this test and say there is no regression on very odd case cases and.

527
01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:17.130
Developer: This is the way I want to to to guarantee the.

528
01:00:19.110 --> 01:00:20.940
Developer: rendering of the image.

529
01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:26.490
Developer: Okay, it is a test in general it's a good.

530
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:31.620
Developer: good thing for for guarantee the CG.

531
01:00:33.810 --> 01:00:35.520
Interviewer: Okay, and I suppose that.

532
01:00:37.770 --> 01:00:42.510
Interviewer: You implemented certain algorithms in your software.

533
01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:43.800
Interviewer: And I do think.

534
01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:53.610
Interviewer: Other developers, we can produce the same results by using the same process and algorithms you used.

535
01:00:56.910 --> 01:01:08.940
Developer: Yes, sometime just make an implementation of concept or stand out on follow yes.

536
01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:17.940
Developer: You mean if you if we compare or so he with other software.

537
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:19.680
Developer: or.

538
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:24.090
Interviewer: Not comparing were no other software.

539
01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:27.060
Interviewer: I.

540
01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.620
Interviewer: saw me Ray organized so.

541
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:37.050
Interviewer: I was actually asking much honey, the reproducibility but also the.

542
01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.050
Interviewer: correctness of the software.

543
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:44.040
Interviewer: Okay, I suppose that you adapt some algorithms.

544
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:53.130
Interviewer: And the you adapt or some process of computing you think if other developers they use the we choose.

545
01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:54.720
Developer: Yes, or is.

546
01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:56.130
Interviewer: It the same results.

547
01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:59.940
Developer: And it's difficult to answer.

548
01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:01.800
This question but.

549
01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:11.760
Developer: I would say yes, he he it is sometimes difficult to understand what is correct or so.

550
01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:18.000
Developer: that's, the main thing because sometimes there is a discussion.

551
01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:30.720
Developer: With very expert on the domain and we all not agree about things, and so that's that's the point or so the correctness.

552
01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:57.630
Developer: I I tried to to to have reference, also in the day coma forum, sometimes when I have a problem i'm not sure to have the good answer I asked in this forum and to have a maybe a more common discussion with the experts, so it is a way I proceed for that and.

553
01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:14.160
Developer: May, yes, I know there is some part in the code, they are risky to to change because, and I will be a very.

554
01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:33.510
Developer: With my one my my colleagues, sometimes they want you want to change apart, I say to him, be careful, this is a very complex part and if you change something be sure there is no impact other place and.

555
01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:46.680
Developer: Yes, and there are some part of the card that sometimes challenging and I try to make also documentation on the card when there are very.

556
01:03:47.580 --> 01:04:05.580
Developer: Specific stuff or I go in, there are a bit tricky and I said this is tricky and sometimes I say what what is the problem, and what I say, because sometimes you don't remember maybe one year later.

557
01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:15.300
Developer: What you have done, and why you have done in this way, so I think I don't put a lot of comment in the card, but.

558
01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:31.050
Developer: I think the most important comment is that in the codes, it is when you you you you do something tricky in the card, and you have to document you have to let her comment in the code it's very important anything.

559
01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:38.160
Interviewer: Okay gotcha and yeah I think that's actually a very it's very heavy I remember this suggestion you may 5.
