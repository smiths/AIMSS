Peter-SolverSolutions_filtered.xlsx is an updated detailed list of all potential LBM solvers to study. Solvers that will no longer be considered are highlighted in red.

Peter-Notes-SolutionDescriptions has brief descriptions and links of LBM solutions that were originally considered for measurement. 

Peter-Notes-QualityMeasure contains definitions, metrics and notes on robustness, performance, maintainability, reusability, and portability as well as a list of variabilities for LBM solvers.

Peter-Notes-Installability includes advice on improving installability.

LBS_Combined_MeasurementTemplate_EmpiricalMeasures_ImpressionCalculation.xlsx is a guide on how to calculate the impression calculaiton figure for each quality.

Commonality-Analysis files are specific for LBM

FeatureDiagramLBS is for the commonality analysis pdf and tex files

Completed_LBS_Combined_MeasurementTemplate_EmpiricalMeasures.xlsx contains final measurement values
