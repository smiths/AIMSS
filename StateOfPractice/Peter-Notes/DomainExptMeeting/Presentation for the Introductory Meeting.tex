\bi
\item Goals
  \bi
  \item Understand the state of the software development practices for
    LBM Software
  \item Make recommendations for improvements
  \item A publication that is useful to the community
  \ei  
\item We have developed a standard methdology for assessing SOP for Domain X
\item The methodology requires a \textbf{domain expert} to:
  \bi
  \item Vet the preliminary results
  \item Assess the feasibility of the recommendations
  \item Navigate the publication process
  \item Answer \textbf{developer} interview questions on pain points  
  \ei
\item Today's meeting
