	abstract = {Software is now a vital scientific instrument, provid- ing the tools for data collection and analysis across disciplines from bioinformatics and computational physics, to the human- ities. The software used in research is often home-grown and bespoke: it is constructed for a particular project, and rarely maintained beyond this, leading to rapid decay, and frequent `reinvention of the wheel'. Understanding how to develop sus- tainable research software, such that it is suitable for future reuse, is therefore of interest to both researchers and funders, but how to achieve this remains an open question. Here we report the results of an interview study examining how research software engineers -- the people actively developing software in an academic research environment -- subjectively define soft- ware sustainability. Thematic analysis of the data reveals two interacting dimensions: intrinsic sustainability, which relates to internal qualities of software, such as modularity, encapsulation and testability, and extrinsic sustainability, concerning cultural and organisational factors, including how software is resourced, supported and shared. Research software engineers believe an increased focus on quality and discoverability are key factors in increasing the sustainability of academic research software.},

	abstract = {
        Software is a critical part of modern research and yet there is little support across the scholarly ecosystem for its acknowledgement and citation. Inspired by the activities of the FORCE11 working group focused on data citation, this document summarizes the recommendations of the FORCE11 Software Citation Working Group and its activities between June 2015 and April 2016. Based on a review of existing community practices, the goal of the working group was to produce a consolidated set of citation principles that may encourage broad adoption of a consistent policy for software citation across disciplines and venues. Our work is presented here as a set of software citation principles, a discussion of the motivations for developing the principles, reviews of existing community practice, and a discussion of the requirements these principles would place upon different stakeholders. Working examples and possible technical solutions for how these principles can be implemented will be discussed in a separate paper.

@article{SmithEtAl2018-joss,
	abstract = {This article describes the motivation, design, and progress of the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS). JOSS is a free and open-access journal that publishes articles describing research software. It has the dual goals of improving the quality of the software submitted and providing a mechanism for research software developers to receive credit. While designed to work within the current merit system of science, JOSS addresses the dearth of rewards for key contributions to science made in the form of software. JOSS publishes articles that encapsulate scholarship contained in the software itself, and its rigorous peer review targets the software components: functionality, documentation, tests, continuous integration, and the license. A JOSS article contains an abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software, references, and a link to the software archive. The article is the entry point of a JOSS submission, which encompasses the full set of software artifacts. Submission and review proceed in the open, on GitHub. Editors, reviewers, and authors work collaboratively and openly. Unlike other journals, JOSS does not reject articles requiring major revision; while not yet accepted, articles remain visible and under review until the authors make adequate changes (or withdraw, if unable to meet requirements). Once an article is accepted, JOSS gives it a digital object identifier (DOI), deposits its metadata in Crossref, and the article can begin collecting citations on indexers like Google Scholar and other services. Authors retain copyright of their JOSS article, releasing it under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. In its first year, starting in May 2016, JOSS published 111 articles, with more than 40 additional articles under review. JOSS is a sponsored project of the nonprofit organization NumFOCUS and is an affiliate of the Open Source Initiative (OSI).},

@article{HowisonAndBullard2016,
	abstract = {Software is increasingly crucial to scholarship, yet the visibility and usefulness of software in the scientific record are in question. Just as with data, the visibility of software in publications is related to incentives to share software in reusable ways, and so promote efficient science. In this article, we examine software in publications through content analysis of a random sample of 90 biology articles. We develop a coding scheme to identify software "mentions" and classify them according to their characteristics and ability to realize the functions of citations. Overall, we find diverse and problematic practices: Only between 31% and 43% of mentions involve formal citations; informal mentions are very common, even in high impact factor journals and across different kinds of software. Software is frequently inaccessible 15%-29% of packages in any form; between 90% and 98% of specific versions; only between 24%-40% provide source code. Cites to publications are particularly poor at providing version information, whereas informal mentions are particularly poor at providing crediting information. We provide recommendations to improve the practice of software citation, highlighting recent nascent efforts. Software plays an increasingly great role in scientific practice; it deserves a clear and useful place in scholarly communication.},

	abstract = {The corporate market is now embracing free, "open source" software like never before, as evidenced by the recent success of the technologies underlying LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). Each is the result of a publicly collaborative process among numerous developers who volunteer their time and energy to create better software. The truth is, however, that the overwhelming majority of free software projects fail. To help you beat the odds, O'Reilly has put together Producing Open Source Software, a guide that recommends tried and true steps to help free software developers work together toward a common goal. Not just for developers who are considering starting their own free software project, this book will also help those who want to participate in the process at any level. The book tackles this very complex topic by distilling it down into easily understandable parts. Starting with the basics of project management, it details specific tools used in free software projects, including version control, IRC, bug tracking, and Wikis. Author Karl Fogel, known for his work on CVS and Subversion, offers practical advice on how to set up and use a range of tools in combination with open mailing lists and archives. He also provides several chapters on the essentials of recruiting and motivating developers, as well as how to gain much-needed publicity for your project. While managing a team of enthusiastic developers -- most of whom you've never even met -- can be challenging, it can also be fun. Producing Open Source Software takes this into account, too, as it speaks of the sheer pleasure to be had from working with a motivated team of free software developers.},

	abstract = {Research software, which includes both source code and executables used as part of
the research process, presents a significant challenge for efforts aimed at ensuring
reproducibility. In order to inform such efforts, we conducted a survey to better
understand the characteristics of research software as well as how it is created, used,
and shared by researchers. Based on the responses of 215 participants, representing a
range of research disciplines, we found that researchers create, use, and share software
in a wide variety of forms for a wide variety of purposes, including data collection,
data analysis, data visualization, data cleaning and organization, and automation. More
participants indicated that they use open source software than commercial software.
While a relatively small number of programming languages (e.g., Python, R, JavaScript,
C++, MATLAB) are used by a large number, there is a long tail of languages used by
relatively few. Between-group comparisons revealed that significantly more participants
from computer science write source code and create executables than participants from
other disciplines. Differences between researchers from computer science and other
disciplines related to the knowledge of best practices of software creation and sharing
were not statistically significant. While many participants indicated that they draw
a distinction between the sharing and preservation of software, related practices and
perceptions were often not aligned with those of the broader scholarly communications
community.

focus on the importance of concepts such as proper documentation and version control
in ensuring that code is shared in a way that facilitates computational reproducibility. In
contrast, the focus of community organizations such as The Carpentries (Wilson, 2006;
Teal et al., 2015) and the Software Sustainability Institute (Crouch et al., 2013) is training
researchers to better develop, use, and maintain software tools. Bridging the perspectives of
stakeholders focused on encouraging best practices in sharing software and those focused
on educating researchers in its creation and use are organizations such as Force11, who
have published guidelines for describing and citing software in the scholarly literature
(Smith, Katz & Niemeyer, 2016).''

	abstract = {The scientific software community is eagerly embracing software development practices and tools. However, the lack of Computer Science background, in general, and Software Engineering training, in particular, pose a toll on scientists that need to develop software. Although some of the problems that scientific software developers face when developing scientific software are already known in the literature, we believe that a comprehensive characterization of this complex landscape is still missing. In this paper we build a taxonomy of 2,110 problems (the so called ``pains'') reported by 1,577 scientific software developers. These problems are grouped into three major axes: technical-related, social-related, and scientific-related problems. Our report helps to better understand the needs and challenges of this so far not fully understood community.},
	annote = {``Technical-related problems are by far the most common problems that our scientific software developers face. As Figure 1 shows, technical-related problems represent more than 70% of the overall set of problems. The percentages represent the share of respondents that mentioned each pain.''

``According to our respondents, ​Software Requirements and Management is the software engineering discipline that most hurts scientific developers (they account for 23% of the technical problems reported).''

``Problems related to the evolution of ​Functional Requirements (e.g., ``​The objective changes after having worked on it for months​'') was cited by many respondents. Moreover, in spite of its importance, we perceived that writing a good ​Documentation also poses a major issue. For instance, one respondent mentioned that ``​I work with biologists that have little knowledge of programming. Therefore, the software must be easy to use. Write a clear documentation is always a challenge​''. ​Documentation issues are 8.7% of the total problems raised by the respondents, considering the technical, social and scientific-related problems group.''

``Scientific developers also face a hard time when conducting ​Software Testing and Debugging activities, which represents more than 14% of the total pains presented. This is particularly relevant due to the intrinsic non-deterministic nature of exploring research questions, as one respondent mentioned: ``​It's frequently difficult to test scientific software, since you might not even know in advance what the answer should be​''.''

``Finally, the ​Other category groups pains associated with, for instance, the lack of programming background (e.g., ``​not having a software development background (i.e.: learning on the fly)​''), the algorithms' performance (e.g., ``​optimizing code that is not running fast enough (pure engineering issue)​''), and the user experience (e.g., ``​anticipating user behavior and designing [a good] user interface​''). Note that, problems regarding ​Programming Background and software ​Performance represent more than 9% of the total problems cited.''},

	abstract = {README files play an essential role in shaping a developer's first impression of a software repository and in documenting the software project that the repository hosts. Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the content of a typical README file as well as tools that can process these files automatically. To close this gap, we conduct a qualitative study involving the manual annotation of 4,226 README file sections from 393 randomly sampled GitHub repositories and we design and evaluate a classifier and a set of features that can categorize these sections automatically. We find that information discussing the `What' and `How' of a repository is very common, while many README files lack information regarding the purpose and status of a repository. Our multi-label classifier which can predict eight different categories achieves an F1 score of 0.746. To evaluate the usefulness of the classification, we used the automatically determined classes to label sections in GitHub README files using badges and showed files with and without these badges to twenty software professionals. The majority of participants perceived the automated labeling of sections based on our classifier to ease information discovery. This work enables the owners of software repositories to improve the quality of their documentation and it has the potential to make it easier for the software development community to discover relevant information in GitHub README files.},

@article{SmithAndKoothoor2016,
	abstract = {This paper presents a documentation and development method to facilitate the certification of scientific computing software used in the safety analysis of nuclear facilities. To study the problems faced during quality assurance and certification activities, a case study was performed on legacy software used for thermal analysis of a fuelpin in a nuclear reactor. Although no errors were uncovered in the code, 27 issues of incompleteness and inconsistency were found with the documentation. This work proposes that software documentation follow a rational process, which includes a software requirements specification following a template that is reusable, maintainable, and understandable. To develop the design and implementation, this paper suggests literate programming as an alternative to traditional structured programming. Literate programming allows for documenting of numerical algorithms and code together in what is termed the literate programmer's manual. This manual is developed with explicit traceability to the software requirements specification. The traceability between the theory, numerical algorithms, and implementation facilitates achieving completeness and consistency, as well as simplifies the process of verification and the associated certification.},

@article{Gomez-DiazAndRecio2019,
	abstract = {Background: Evaluation of the quality of research software is a challenging and relevant issue, still not sufficiently addressed by the scientific community. Methods: Our contribution begins by defining, precisely but widely enough, the notions of research software and of its authors followed by a study of the evaluation issues, as the basis for the proposition of a sound assessment protocol: the CDUR procedure. Results: CDUR comprises four steps introduced as follows: Citation, to deal with correct RS identification, Dissemination, to measure good dissemination practices, Use, devoted to the evaluation of usability aspects, and Research, to assess the impact of the scientific work. Conclusions: Some conclusions and recommendations are finally included. The evaluation of research is the keystone to boost the evolution of the Open Science policies and practices.  It is as well our belief that research software evaluation is a fundamental step to induce better research software practices and, thus, a step towards more efficient science.},

As an initial step in creating the xSDK, we have written a set of xSDK community package policies that a software package must satisfy in order to be ​xSDK compatible​. The designation of a package being xSDK compatible informs potential users that the package can be easily used with other xSDK libraries and components and thus helps to address issues in long-term sustainability and interoperability among packages.},

	abstract = {Although the goal of scientists is to do science, not to develop software, many scientists have extended their roles to include software development to their skills. However, since scientists have different background, it remains unclear how do they perceive software engineering practices or how do they acquire software engineering knowledge. In this paper we conducted an external replication of one influential 10 years paper about how scientists develop and use scientific software. In particular, we employed the same method (an on-line questionnaire) in a different population (R developers). When analyzing the more than 1,572 responses received, enriched with data gathered from their GitHub repositories, we correlated our findings with the original study. We found that the results were consistent in many ways, including: (1) scientists that develop software work mostly alone, (2) they decide themselves what they want to work on next, and (3) most of what they learnt came from self-study, rather than a formal education. However, we also uncover new facts, such as: some of the ``pain points'' regarding software development are not related to technical activities (e.g., interruptions, lack of collaborators, and lack of a reward system play a role). Our replication can help researchers, practitioners, and educators to better focus their efforts on topics that are important to the scientific community that develops software.},

That's one day a week, one less semester in a master's degree, or one less year for a typical PhD. The course is called software carpentry, rather than software engineering, to emphasize the fact that it focuses on small-scale and immediately practical issues.

It is part of the parallel simulation framework APES, which utilizes octrees to represent sparse meshes and provides tools from automatic mesh generation to post-processing. The octree mesh representation enables the handling of arbitrarily complex simulation domains, even on massively parallel systems. Local grid refinement is implemented by several interpolation schemes in Musubi. Various kernels provide different physical models based on stream-collide algorithms. These models can be computed concurrently and can be coupled with each other. This paper explains our approach to provide a flexible yet scalable simulation environment and elaborates its design principles and implementation details. The efficiency of our approach is demonstrated with a performance evaluation on two supercomputers and a comparison to the widely used Lattice Boltzmann solver Palabos.},

	abstract = {Coarctation of the aorta (COA) is a congenital narrowing of the proximal descending aorta. Although accurate and early diagnosis of COA hinges on blood flow quantification, proper diagnostic methods for COA are still lacking because fluid-dynamics methods that can be used for accurate flow quantification are not well developed yet. Most importantly, COA and the heart interact with each other and because the heart resides in a complex vascular network that imposes boundary conditions on its function, accurate diagnosis relies on quantifications of the global hemodynamics (heart-function metrics) as well as the local hemodynamics (detailed information of the blood flow dynamics in COA). In this study, to enable the development of new non-invasive methods that can quantify local and global hemodynamics for COA diagnosis, we developed an innovative fast computational-mechanics and imaging-based framework that uses Lattice Boltzmann method and lumped-parameter modeling that only need routine non-invasive clinical patient data. We used clinical data of patients with COA to validate the proposed framework and to demonstrate its abilities to provide new diagnostic analyses not possible with conventional diagnostic methods. We validated this framework against clinical cardiac catheterization data, calculations using the conventional finite-volume method and clinical Doppler echocardiographic measurements. The diagnostic information, that the framework can provide, is vitally needed to improve clinical outcomes, to assess patient risk and to plan treatment.},

	abstract = {Lattice Boltzmann (LB) models can be used to simulate flow in porous media at scales much larger than pore size. LB-based models for such macroscopic scale porous media flow simulations are an extension of standard LB models. There are at least two alternative approaches for implementing such models. In the first approach the local velocity is altered during the collision step by incorporating an external force, F, equivalent to the damping effect of solid particles in porous media. The porous media can be permeable or impermeable depending upon the external forcing term. A sink term is introduced in the LB model to simulate a pumping well and this model is further applied to solve transient ground water well problems for confined aquifers. Directly solving the ground water flow equation with an LB model by exploiting its ability to solve the diffusion equation is another strategy. The second order transient ground water flow equation is analogous to the diffusion equation and mass diffusivity is analogous to hydraulic diffusivity. This diffusion model is used to solve transient ground water problems. Simulated results accurately match analytical solutions of the transient ground water flow equation.},

	abstract = {Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells have higher efficiency and energy density and are capable of rapidly adjusting to power demands. Effective water management is one of the key issues for increasing the efficiency of PEMFC. In the current study, a three-dimensional (3D) lattice Boltzmann model is developed to simulate the water transport and oxygen diffusion in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) of PEM fuel cells with electrochemical reaction on the catalyst layer taken into account. In this paper, we demonstrate that this model is able to predict the liquid and gas flow fields within the 3D GDL structure and how they change with time. With the two-phase flow and electrochemical reaction coupled in the model, concentration of oxygen through the GDL and current density distribution can also be predicted. The model is then used to investigate the effect of microporous layer on the cell performance in 2D to reduce the computational cost. The results clearly show that the liquid water content can be reduced with the existence of microporous layer and thus the current density can be increased.},

 	is integral to our understanding of good scientific practice, it has remained a difficult concept to define
 	precisely. Across scientific disciplines, the increasing prevalence of large datasets, and the computational
 	techniques necessary to manage and analyze those datasets, has prompted new ways of thinking about
 	reproducibility. We present findings from a qualitative study of a NSF--funded two-week workshop developed
 	to introduce an interdisciplinary group of domain scientists to data-management techniques for data-intensive
 	computing, with a focus on reproducible science. Our findings suggest that the introduction of data-related
 	activities promotes a new understanding of reproducibility as a mechanism for local knowledge transfer and
 	collaboration, particularly as regards efficient software reuse.},

Requirements engineers need to examine this often incomplete and inconsistent brief expression of needs. Based on the available knowledge and expertise, assumptions are made and conclusions are deduced to transform this `rough sketch' into more complete, consistent, and hence correct requirements. This paper addresses the question of how to characterize these properties in an evolutionary framework, and what relationships link these properties to a customer's view of correctness. Moreover, we describe in rigorous terms the different kinds of validation checks that must be performed on different parts of a requirements specification in order to ensure that errors (i.e. cases of inconsistency and incompleteness) are detected and marked as such, leading to better quality requirements.},

Sustainabilitywithin soware engineering is something that has recently started to gain traction, where most of theresearch has focused on the environmental dimension.e purpose of this study was to investigate the technicalsustainability dimension, and contribute by continuing to build upon previous research which has suggestedsustainability as a part of non-functional requirements and as a part of soware quality.is study was conducted with a qualitative approach. is approach used interviews with people withexperience of working in soware development to collect data. e interviews were used to gain in-depthinformation of the dierent aspects in soware development, e.g. development processes.e results, based on the interviews, showed that from a technical sustainability perspective there are issueswith where the focus of the work is in soware development and also problems related to how timemanagementis used.e results also showed that there was some lacking in understanding the benets and tradeos ofdecisions made in the project, for example regarding the soware design, which can result in unnecessarycomplexity is acquired.e study found that the culture within soware development projects and companies needs to be changedtowards a culture which promotes the development of high quality soware. Because non-functional requirementsand soware quality are components of technical sustainability, therefore is the technical sustainabilityhigher if the quality is high. It was further found that this culture would be possible if changes were made tothe way prioritisations are made, and the way testing is performed should be extended. Finally it was foundthat the understanding of the benets and tradeos of decisions and ideas needs to be increased and extendedcollectively.e study concluded that the technical sustainability dimension can be achieved through these changes andthat the problem and solution therefore are not small and local but rather a big and complex issue where thesolution spans several solutions that encompasses dierent aspects and perspectives. },

However, there is currently no agreed definition of the concept. Current definitions range from a composite, non-functional requirement to simply an emergent property. This lack of clarity leads to confusion, and potentially to ineffective and inefficient efforts to develop sustainable software systems. The aim of this paper is to explore the emerging definitions of software sustainability from the field of software engineering in order to contribute to the question, what is software sustainability? The preliminary analysis suggests that the concept of software sustainability is complex and multifaceted with any consensus towards a shared definition within the field of software engineering yet to be achieved.},

@book{Brundtland1987,
	abstract = {Most of today's decision makers will be dead before the planet suffers the full consequences of acid rain, global warning, ozone depletion, widespread desertification, and species loss. Most of today's young voters, however, will be alive. In this, perhaps the most important document of the decade on the future of the world, the urgency of changing certain policy decisions, some of which threaten the very survival of the human race, is made abundantly clear. The World Commission on Environment and Development, headed by Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of Norway, was set up as an independent body in 1983 by the United Nations. Its brief was to re-examine the critical environment, to develop proposals to solve them, and to ensure that human progress will be sustained through development without bankrupting the resources of future generations. In Our Common Future, the Commission serves notice that the time has come for a marriage of economy and ecology, so that governments and their people can take responsibility not just for environmental damage, but for the policies that cause the damage. It is not too late to change these policies; but, it warns, we must act now.},

@article{RunesonAndHost2009,
	abstract = {Case study is a suitable research methodology for software engineering research since it studies contemporary phenomena in its natural context. However, the understanding of what constitutes a case study varies, and hence the quality of the resulting studies. This paper aims at providing an introduction to case study methodology and guidelines for researchers conducting case studies and readers studying reports of such studies. The content is based on the authors' own experience from conducting and reading case studies. The terminology and guidelines are compiled from different methodology handbooks in other research domains, in particular social science and information systems, and adapted to the needs in software engineering. We present recommended practices for software engineering case studies as well as empirically derived and evaluated checklists for researchers and readers of case study research.},
	annote = {- Case studies do not generate the same results on e.g. causal relationships as controlled experiments do, but they provide deeper understanding of the phenomena under study. 
 	- case study is an empirical method aimed at investigating contemporary phenomena in their context.  - uses multiple sources of evidence, boundary between the phenomenon and its context may be unclear, information gathering from few entities (people, groups, organizations), lack of experimental control.
 	- a case study may contain elements of other research methods, e.g. a survey may be conducted within a case study, literature search often precede a case study and archival analyses may be a part of its data collection. Ethnographic methods, like interviews and observations are mostly used for data collection in case studies.
 	- Action research, with its purpose to ``influence or change some aspect of whatever is the focus of the research'' (Robson 2002), is closely related to case study. More strictly, a case study is purely observational while action research is focused on and involved in the change process. {Research using Drasil seems to be Action research} - when studying the effects of a change, e.g. in pre- and post-event studies, we classify the methodology as case study.
 	
 	We distinguish between four types of purposes for research based on Robson's (2002) classification:
 	& Exploratory---finding out what is happening, seeking new insights and generating ideas and hypotheses for new research.
 	& Descriptive---portraying a situation or phenomenon.
 	& Explanatory---seeking an explanation of a situation or a problem, mostly but not necessary in the form of a causal relationship.
 	& Improving---trying to improve a certain aspect of the studied phenomenon. - case studies in software engineering often take an improvement approach, similar to action research
 	
 	{Research on using Drasil will be of the Exploratory and Improving classifications}
 	
 	- Case studies are by definition conducted in real world settings, and thus have a high degree of realism, mostly at the expense of the level of control.
 	
 	Case studies tend mostly to be based on qualitative data, as these provide a richer and deeper description. However, a combination of qualitative and quantitative data often provides better understanding of the studied phenomenon (Seaman 1999), i.e. what is sometimes called ``mixed methods'' (Robson 2002).
 	
 	The research process may be characterized as fixed or flexible according to Anastas and MacDonald (1994) and Robson (2002). In a fixed design process, all parameters are defined at the launch of the study, while in a flexible design process key parameters of the study may be changed during the course of the study. Case studies are typically flexible design studies, while experiments and surveys are fixed design studies.
 	
 	Four different types of triangulation may be applied (Stake 1995):
 	& Data (source) triangulation---using more than one data source or collecting the same data at different occasions.
 	& Observer triangulation---using more than one observer in the study.
 	& Methodological triangulation---combining different types of data collection methods,
 	e.g. qualitative and quantitative methods.
 	& Theory triangulation---using alternative theories or viewpoints.
 	
 	{For Drasil NSERC - collect data from different sources, use more than one observer? combine different types of data collection methods, theory triangulation - Drasil versus Epsilon}
 	
 	Perry et al. define similar criteria for a case study (Perry et al. 2005). It is expected that a case study:
 	- ``Has research questions set out from the beginning of the study
 	- Data is collected in a planned and consistent manner
 	- Inferences are made from the data to answer the research question
 	- Explores a phenomenon, or produces an explanation, description, or causal analysis of it Threats to validity are addressed in a systematic way.''
 	
 	- In summary, the key characteristics of a case study are that 1) it is of flexible type, coping with the complex and dynamic characteristics of real world phenomena, like software engineering, 2) its conclusions are based on a clear chain of evidence, whether qualitative or quantitative, collected from multiple sources in a planned and consistent manner, and 3) it adds to existing knowledge by being based on previously established theory, if such exist, or by building theory.
 	
 	When conducting a case study, there are five major process steps to be walked through:
 	1. Case study design: objectives are defined and the case study is planned.
 	2. Preparation for data collection: procedures and protocols for data collection are defined.
 	3. Collecting evidence: execution with data collection on the studied case.
 	4. Analysis of collected data
 	5. Reporting
 	
 	Definitions:
 	- The overall objective is a statement of what is expected to be achieved in the case study.
 	- The objective is refined into a set of research questions, which are to be answered through the case study analysis.
 	- A case may be based on a software engineering theory.
 	- A research question may be related to a hypothesis
 	- A case study protocol defines the detailed procedures for collection and analysis of the raw data, sometimes called field procedures.
 	
 	A plan for a case study should at least contain the following elements (Robson 2002):
 	& Objective---what to achieve?
 	& The case---what is studied?
 	& Theory---frame of reference
 	& Research questions---what to know?
 	& Methods---how to collect data?
 	& Selection strategy---where to seek data?
 	
 	{There are case study protocol templates available on-line}

	annote = {1. INTRODUCTION
 	
 	- paper published in 2002 - at the time the authors observed that the standard for empirical software engineering resarch was poor
 	- empirical studies are challenging - medical and phychiatric fields still struggle (citations given to show this)
 	- would expect different guildelines for different purposes (randomized trials, surveys, exploratory stides, etc.)
 	- guidelines under six basic topic areas:
 	- experimental context
 	- experimental design
 	- conduct of experiment and data collection
 	- analysis
 	- presentation of results
 	- interpretation of results
 	
 	2. EXPERIMENTAL CONTEXT
 	
 	- experimental context has three elements: background information about the industrial circumstances in which am empicral study takes place, discuss the research hypotheses, information about related research
 	- C1: Be sure to specify as much of the industrial context as possible.  In particular, clearly define the entities, attributes, and measures that are capturing the contextual information
 	- two types of empirical studies: observational and formal experiments
 	
 	2.2.1 Observational Studies
 	
 	- researchers need to identify the particular factors that might ffect the generality and utlility of the conclusions, such as: the industry in which products are made, nature of software dev organization, skills and experience of software staff, type of software products, software process being used
 	- important not only to identify appropriate contextual variables, but also to measure them consistently - followed by discussion that even lines of code is defined differently by different researchers
 	
 	2.2.2 Formal Experiments
 	
 	- make sure that the experiments are not too much of an oversimplification of reality
 	- make sure to not ignore other measures - for instance, even if the intervention has no effect on performance, it might have an affect on other benefits (example given of inspection techniques)
 	- C2: If a specific hypothesis is being tested, state it clearly prior to performing the study and discuss the theory from which it is derived, so that its implications are apparent
 	- avoid shallow hypothesis - relate hyptheses to theory
 	- C3: If the research is exploratory, state clearly and, prior to data analysis, what questions the investigation is intended to address and how it will address them.
 	- define research questions in advance
 	- C4: Describe resarch that is similar to, or has a bearing on, the current research and how current work relates to it.
 	
 	3 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
 	
 	- describe the products, resources and processes involved in the study
 	- D1: Identify the population from which the subjects and objects are drawn.
 	- D2: Define the process by which the subjects and objects were selected.
 	- D3: Define the process by which the subjects and objects are assigned to treatments.
 	- make the assignment unbiased
 	- if use more complex designs, or non-randomized design, include a statistics expert on the team
 	- D4: Restrict yourself to simply study design, or consult a statistician
 	- D6: For formal experiments, perform a pre-experiment or precalcuation to identify or estimate the minimum required sample size,
 	- D7: Use appropriate levels of blinding
 	- not always possible, since subjects will know what technique they are using (unlike a patient taking medicine)
 	- D8: If you cannot avoid evaluationg your own work, then make explicit any vested interests (including your sources of support) and report what  you have done to minimize bias.
 	- D9: Avoid the use of controls unless you are sure the control situation can be unambiguously defined
 	- usually there is no common default technology - cannot really compare ``with'' a technology to ``without'' the technology, because the ``without'' will be different for different groups, organization, companies, individuals.  Can compare two techniques.
 	- D10: Fully define all treatments (interventions)
 	- D11: Justify the choice of outcomes measures in terms of their relevance to the objectives of the empirical study
 	
 	Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 - more detail on statistical measures, quality control, presentation, outliers etc.

	abstract = {We present the design and implementation of a generative geometric kernel. The kernel generator is generic, type-safe, parametrized by many design-level choices and extensible.  The resulting code has minimal traces of the design abstractions.  We achieve genericity through a layered design deriving concepts from affine geometry, linear algebra and abstract algebra.  We achieve parametrization and type-safety by using OCaml's module system, including higher order modules. The cost of abstraction is removed by using MetaOCaml's support for code generation coupled with some annotations atop the code type.},

@article{LucivEtAl2018,
	abstract = {Contemporary software documentation is as complicated as the software itself. During its lifecycle, the documentation accumulates a lot of ``near duplicate'' fragments, i.e. chunks of text that were copied from a single source and were later modified in different ways. Such near duplicates decrease documentation quality and thus hamper its further utilization. At the same time, they are hard to detect manually due to their fuzzy nature. In this paper we give a formal definition of near duplicates and present an algorithm for their detection in software documents. This algorithm is based on the exact software clone detection approach: the software clone detection tool Clone Miner was adapted to detect exact duplicates in documents. Then, our algorithm uses these exact duplicates to construct near ones. We evaluate the proposed algorithm using the documentation of 19 open source and commercial projects. Our evaluation is very comprehensive -- it covers various documentation types: design and requirement specifications, programming guides and API documentation, user manuals. Overall, the evaluation shows that all kinds of software documentation contain a significant number of both exact and near duplicates. Next, we report on the performed manual analysis of the detected near duplicates for the Linux Kernel Documentation. We present both quantative and qualitative results of this analysis, demonstrate algorithm strengths and weaknesses, and discuss the benefits of duplicate management in software documents.},

	abstract = {The use of software is pervasive in all fields of science. Associated software development efforts may be very large, long lived, and complex, requiring the commitment of significant resources. However, several authors have argued that the ``gap'' or ``chasm'' between software engineering and scientific programming is a serious risk to the production of reliable scientific results, as demonstrated in a number of case studies. This article reviews the research that addresses the gap, exploring how both software engineering and research practice may need to evolve to accommodate the use of software in science.},

	abstract = {Large-scale collaborative scientific software projects require more knowledge than any one person typically possesses. This makes coordination and communication of knowledge and expertise a key factor in creating and safeguarding software quality, without which we cannot have sustainable software. However, as researchers attempt to scale up the production of software, they are confronted by problems of awareness and understanding. This presents an opportunity to develop better practices and tools that directly address these challenges. To that end, we conducted a case study of developers of the Trilinos project. We surveyed the software development challenges addressed and show how those problems are connected with what they know and how they communicate. Based on these data, we provide a series of practicable recommendations, and outline a path forward for future research.},
	annote = {- cites Drasil (Dan's position paper) and Thulasi's work (5 redevelopment projects)
 	- seems like MandR assumed the potential problems - should have provided an opportunity for new problems to emerge from user feedback
 	- they implied that Drasil cannot capture tacit knowledge that cannot be codefied, likely because they misunderstood Drasil
 	- if Drasil is successful, much of the knowledge they are referring to only has to be entered once, the communication is through documentation, mistakes cannot be repeated in the same way as the anecdote in the paper because the code is generated},

In the absence of any one of those requirements, one doesn't have the assurance of independent assessment, confirmation, and repeatability of results. Because it's impossible to judge the validity of such results, they often have little credibility and no impact.''
