@inproceedings{PintoEtAl2018,
	abstract = {Although the goal of scientists is to do science, not to develop software, many scientists have extended their roles to include software development to their skills. However, since scientists have different background, it remains unclear how do they perceive software engineering practices or how do they acquire software engineering knowledge. In this paper we conducted an external replication of one influential 10 years paper about how scientists develop and use scientific software. In particular, we employed the same method (an on-line questionnaire) in a different population (R developers). When analyzing the more than 1,572 responses received, enriched with data gathered from their GitHub repositories, we correlated our findings with the original study. We found that the results were consistent in many ways, including: (1) scientists that develop software work mostly alone, (2) they decide themselves what they want to work on next, and (3) most of what they learnt came from self-study, rather than a formal education. However, we also uncover new facts, such as: some of the ``pain points'' regarding software development are not related to technical activities (e.g., interruptions, lack of collaborators, and lack of a reward system play a role). Our replication can help researchers, practitioners, and educators to better focus their efforts on topics that are important to the scientific community that develops software.},

	annote = {3.5 Documentation

Figure 13 shows the number of respondents who indi- cated they produce certain types of documentation. The most common type of documentation produced by respon- dents was comments in the code, selected by 51 out of 60 respondents. At the other end of the scale, requirements documentation is the least commonly produced type of doc- umentation with only 18 respondents indicating that they commonly produce such artifacts.
The comparative lack of documentation for requirements and design matches the experiences described by Sanders and Kelly [12]. In their study which involved interviewing 16 scientists, `none of [the] interviewees created an up-front formal requirements specification', and `Only one intervie- wee ... demonstrated his design documentation'.

In our survey, 42 out of 60 respondents indicated they commonly produced user manuals and/or guides. However, as seen in Section 3.4, only 25 respondents indicated they often or always produced software for larger groups of up to 100 people and/or an international community of users. Therefore, at least 17 respondents are producing user manu- als and/or guides for themselves or users in their local area. This is at odds with Sanders and Kelly [12], who noted that none of their interviewees `produced user documentation un- less their software was intended for use outside their research group'.

Only three respondents in our survey mentioned docu- mentation being required or compulsory by users or cus- tomers. However, each type of documentation was com- monly produced by around 20 to 40 of the 60 respondents. This contrasts to Segal [15] who identified that professional end user developers (non-software domain specialists who produce software for specific purposes) `did not voluntar- ily produce documentation, apart from the occasional user guide'.

The survey respondents were also asked why documenta- tion is or is not commonly produced for scientific software applications which they have worked on. From the 50 re- sponses to this open-ended question, a range of reasons both for an against the production of documentation were identi- fied using the coding data collection and analysis technique [13].
The most common reasons for and against the production of documentation and their popularity are shown in Figure 14. Note that these these reasons are not mutually exclusive and are not complete. Many respondents provided both rea- sons for and against the production of documentation. Some reasons were only provided by a single respondent and are not included above.},
