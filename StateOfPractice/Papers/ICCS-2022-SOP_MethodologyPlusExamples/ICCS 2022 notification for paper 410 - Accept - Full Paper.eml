Dear Spencer Smith,

Thank you for your submission to the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS). Please read below for the decision on your paper.

This year's ICCS will take place in a hybrid format. While we encourage participants to join us in-person, those who are not able to will have the option to attend online. When registering, you can choose to participate either in-person or online.

As always, submission to ICCS was very competitive, with over 500 submissions. The program committee and conference chairs had to carefully select papers of the highest quality and relevance to the field of Computational Science.

We are pleased to inform you that your paper (see below) has been accepted for publication (as a 14-page full paper in Springer's LNCS Series) and oral presentation (20 minutes incl. questions) at the conference.

410  Digging Deeper Into the State of the Practice for Domain Specific Research Software

Acceptance is still conditional on the following:

1. That you revise your paper taking into account the reviewers' comments, strictly following the guidelines for camera-ready submission, and submit your final version before the deadline of 11 April 2022. Detailed instructions on how to submit your camera-ready paper will be sent in a few days, in a separate e-mail.

2. That you register for the conference before the author registration deadline (11 April 2022): https://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2022/registration/

Please note that the registration deadline is strict. Only those papers registered until this date will be included in the proceedings.

We wish you good health in these troubled times. 

With best regards,
The SE4Science Chairs

----------- Comments for the authors -----------
Overall, the authors did a good job of developing a methodology to assess the state of the software development practices in research software. The authors mined research software repositories and interviewed domain experts to do so. However, there is some primary concern about the paper's motivation and presentation. 

- The Abstract lacks the motivation for the problem and the implications of the results. 
- The Introduction section could be a lot better. It should have described the problem and motivation behind the solution clearly. In addition, since there is no Background/Related work section, the introduction section should have discussed some of the related works more to provide a foundation of the study. 
- Some of the research questions are vague. For example, the authors talked about "current best practices" without spelling out or citing current best practices, "compare to research software in general," without providing the characteristics of research software in general. It was unclear what was going to be compared—similarly, tools and pain points of research software in general. The paper should specifically talk about all these points with proper citation. 
- The authors had a straightforward methodology to perform the study. 
- The presentation of the results and the mapping between the research questions and findings could have been presented better. For example, while the answers to the other RQs have their own section, RQ1 and RQ2 are blended with the methodology section. 
- RQ8 should have been specifically called out in section 7. It was mentioned in the introduction section but never called out after that.

----------- Comments for the authors -----------
The paper describes an approach to evaluate the state of practice of domain specific research software in a generic way. Therewith an important step is done regarding the comparability of domains regading software development practices. The mix of repository mining and developer interviews is a great approach. Ideally, it could be used to also cross-check the assesment. For example, it is stated that some interviews suggested that CI is more commonly used as the analysis of the repository predicted, but it is not stated if this was used to adapt the existing assesment of the software. 
	Also mixing automated analysis with manual evaluation is a good approach. Since the required time for an assesment of a whole domain is still high, trying to introduce more automatic analysis tools should be a next step. 
	
	In total I think this paper is a very valuable contribution to the workshop and is a step in the right direction of research software analysis. 
	
	Despite all this praise, I discovered one flaw: In "Table 3 - Recommended artifacts in software development guidelines" at least for [16] the table is not correct. LICENSE, README, CONTRIBUTING, and CHANGELOG are required by the guideline as well. While the file names are not all stated explicitly, it is implicitly stated that these artifacts needs to be provided. README and CONTRIBUTING are even mentioned explicitly as possibile implementations for such artifacts.

----------- Comments for the authors -----------
This paper proposes a methodology for assessing the state of the software development practice for a given research software domain, which includes a measurement template that consists of 108 questions that assess nine qualities such as installability, usability etc

The paper states a clear purpose combined with a set of research questions and explains why the problem is important. The methodology is extremely weak and does not appear to be appropriate for the stated purpose. The methodology does not describe in sufficient detail what, where, when and how data were collected or how the data was analysed. The paper presents some results, which do not appear to directly address the research questions under investigation. The paper does not summarize and synthesizes a reasonable selection of related work and there is no real attempt to clearly describes the relationship between the author's contribution(s) and related work. While the paper discusses implications of the results and the study's limitations including threats to validity it is not clear that this is underpinned by a robust methodology. The paper states several conclusions but is not supported by explicit evidence since they are nothing valid to compare the results against. Over
all, while the paper fits well with the overall theme of the conference there is a lack of rigour in the development of their proposed methodology and its evaluation. In addition, the paper ignores established profiling tools such as SonarGraph or SonarCloud which provide a deep analysis of VCS information.
