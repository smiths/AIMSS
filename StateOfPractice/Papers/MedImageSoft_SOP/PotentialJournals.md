https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-medical-informatics/vol/187/suppl/C

International Journal of Medical Informatics provides an international medium
for dissemination of original results and interpretative reviews concerning the
field of medical informatics. The Journal emphasizes the evaluation of systems
in healthcare settings.  The scope of journal covers: Information systems,
including national or international registration systems, hospital information
systems, departmental and/or physician's office systems, document handling
systems, electronic medical record systems, standardization, systems integration
etc.; Computer-aided medical decision support systems using heuristic, data
structure, algorithms, statistical methods as exemplified in decision theory,
protocol development, artificial intelligence and, machine learning studies
among other techniques to new knowledge discovering. Thus, it is recommended to
follow the IJMI editorial that provides clear guidance to the articles on
medical Artificial Intelligence. (Cabitza, G; Campagner A) The need to separate
the wheat from the chaff in medical informatics: introducing a comprehensive
checklist for the (self-)assessment of medical AI studies.

1. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging

Impact Factor: 10.6

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=42

IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (T-MI) encourages the submission of
manuscripts on imaging of body structure, morphology and function, including
cell and molecular imaging and all forms of microscopy. The journal publishes
original contributions on medical imaging achieved by modalities including
ultrasound, X-rays, magnetic resonance, radionuclides, microwaves, and optical
methods. Contributions describing novel acquisition techniques, medical image
processing and analysis, visualization and performance, pattern recognition,
machine learning, and related methods are encouraged. Studies involving highly
technical perspectives are most welcome.

The focus of the journal is on unifying the sciences of medicine, biology, and
imaging. It emphasizes the common ground where instrumentation, hardware,
software, mathematics, physics, biology, and medicine interact through new
analysis methods. Strong application papers that describe novel methods are
particularly encouraged. Papers describing important applications based on
medically adopted and/or established methods without significant innovation in
methodology will be directed to other journals.

Submission size on the order of 5000 words.

2. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine

Impact Factor: 3.3

Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (Magn Reson Med) is an international journal
devoted to the publication of original investigations concerned with all aspects
of the development and use of nuclear magnetic resonance and electron
paramagnetic resonance techniques for medical applications. Reports of original
investigations in the areas of mathematics, computing, engineering, physics,
biophysics, chemistry, biochemistry, and physiology directly relevant to
magnetic resonance will be accepted, as well as methodology-oriented clinical
studies.

Submission size on the order of 5000 words.

Time for decision less than 4 weeks.
