	abstract = {
        Software is a critical part of modern research and yet there is little support across the scholarly ecosystem for its acknowledgement and citation. Inspired by the activities of the FORCE11 working group focused on data citation, this document summarizes the recommendations of the FORCE11 Software Citation Working Group and its activities between June 2015 and April 2016. Based on a review of existing community practices, the goal of the working group was to produce a consolidated set of citation principles that may encourage broad adoption of a consistent policy for software citation across disciplines and venues. Our work is presented here as a set of software citation principles, a discussion of the motivations for developing the principles, reviews of existing community practice, and a discussion of the requirements these principles would place upon different stakeholders. Working examples and possible technical solutions for how these principles can be implemented will be discussed in a separate paper.

@article{MengEtAl2018,
	abstract = { The success of an application programming interface (API) crucially depends on how well its documentation meets the information needs of software developers. Previous research suggests that these information needs have not been sufficiently understood. This article presents the results of a series of semistructured interviews and a follow-up questionnaire conducted to explore the learning goals and learning strategies of software developers, the information resources they turn to and the quality criteria they apply to API documentation. Our results show that developers initially try to form a global understanding regarding the overall purpose and main features of an API, but then adopt either a concepts-oriented or a code-oriented learning strategy that API documentation both needs to address. Our results also show that general quality criteria such as completeness and clarity are relevant to API documentation as well. Developing and maintaining API documentation therefore need to involve the expertise of communication professionals. },

@article{SinghEtAl2021,
	abstract = {This paper focuses on codes of conduct (CoC) of Free and Open Source Software (F/OSS) and their role in improving women's participation in online communities of OSS. We investigated 355 F/OSS software package websites for the presence of codes of conduct and then analyzed these for diversity elements. Qualitative content analysis of the websites shows that less than 10{\%} (28) of the analyzed websites had some type of community rules such as CoC. In-depth analysis of the CoCs demonstrated many discrepancies in the terminology, length, enforcement, and adoption of codes of conduct. To investigate the usage of these CoCs, we investigate five women-focused OSS discussion forums. This analysis shows the value of creating/adopting a CoC and the impact CoC  can have on the participation of women. We also present the challenges in the usage and enforcement of CoCs as discussed by women of these forums. We conclude with recommendations for better enforcement of CoC and reflection on the ethical underpinnings of CoC as a tool to improve diversity and inclusion in OSS.},

	abstract = {Assurance cases provide an organized and explicit argument for correctness. They can dramatically improve the quality of scientific software. Assurance cases are already effectively used for real-time safety critical systems. Their advantages for scientific software include engaging domain experts, producing only necessary documentation, and providing evidence that can be verified/replicated. This article illustrates assurance cases through the correctness case for 3dfim+, software for analyzing activity in the brain. The example justifies the value of assurance cases for scientific software, since the existing documentation is shown to have ambiguities and omissions, such as an incompletely defined ranking function and missing details on the coordinate system. We identified a serious concern for 3dfim+: running the software does not produce any warning about the necessity of using data that matches the parametric statistical model employed for the correlation calculations. Raising the bar for scientific software is both feasible and necessary.},

	abstract = {Software peer review is practiced on a diverse set of software projects that have drastically different settings, cultures, incentive systems, and time pressures. In an effort to characterize and understand these differences we examine two Google-led projects, Android and Chromium OS, three Microsoft projects, Bing, Office, and MS SQL, and projects internal to AMD. We contrast our findings with data taken from traditional software inspection conducted on a Lucent project and from open source software peer review on six projects, including Apache, Linux, and KDE. Our measures of interest include the review interval, the number of developers involved in review, and proxy measures for the number of defects found during review. We find that despite differences among projects, many of the characteristics of the review process have independently converged to similar values which we think indicate general principles of code review practice. We also introduce a measure of the degree to which knowledge is shared during review. This is an aspect of review practice that has traditionally only had experiential support. Our knowledge sharing measure shows that conducting peer review increases the number of distinct files a developer knows about by 66% to 150% depending on the project. This paper is one of the first studies of contemporary review in software firms and the most diverse study of peer review to date.},

	abstract = {Code review is a common software engineering practice employed both in open source and industrial contexts. Review today is less formal and more "lightweight" than the code inspections performed and studied in the 70s and 80s. We empirically explore the motivations, challenges, and outcomes of tool-based code reviews. We observed, interviewed, and surveyed developers and managers and manually classified hundreds of review comments across diverse teams at Microsoft. Our study reveals that while finding defects remains the main motivation for review, reviews are less about defects than expected and instead provide additional benefits such as knowledge transfer, increased team awareness, and creation of alternative solutions to problems. Moreover, we find that code and change understanding is the key aspect of code reviewing and that developers employ a wide range of mechanisms to meet their understanding needs, most of which are not met by current tools. We provide recommendations for practitioners and researchers.},

@article{OberEtAl2018,
	abstract = {This paper reports on a four-year project that aims to raise the abstraction level through the use of model-driven engineering (MDE) techniques in the development of scientific applications relying on high-performance computing. The development and maintenance of high-performance scientific computing software is reputedly a complex task. This complexity results from the frequent evolutions of supercomputers and the tight coupling between software and hardware aspects. Moreover, current parallel programming approaches result in a mixing of concerns within the source code. Our approach relies on the use of MDE and consists in defining domain-specific modeling languages targeting various domain experts involved in the development of HPC applications, allowing each of them to handle their dedicated model in a both user-friendly and hardware-independent way. The different concerns are separated thanks to the use of several models as well as several modeling viewpoints on these models. Depending on the targeted execution platforms, these abstract models are translated into executable implementations by means of model transformations. To make all of these effective, we have developed a tool chain that is also presented in this paper. The approach is assessed through a multi-dimensional validation that focuses on its applicability, its expressiveness and its efficiency. To capitalize on the gained experience, we analyze some lessons learned during this project.},

@article{ShahinEtAl2017,
	abstract = {Continuous practices, i.e., continuous integration, delivery, and deployment, are the software
development industry practices that enable organizations to frequently and reliably release new features
and products. With the increasing interest in the literature on continuous practices, it is important to
systematically review and synthesize the approaches, tools, challenges, and practices reported for adopting
and implementing continuous practices. This paper aimed at systematically reviewing the state of the art of
continuous practices to classify approaches and tools, identify challenges and practices in this regard, and
identify the gaps for future research. We used the systematic literature review method for reviewing the peer
reviewed papers on continuous practices published between 2004 and June 1, 2016. We applied the thematic
analysis method for analyzing the data extracted from reviewing 69 papers selected using predefined criteria.
We have identified 30 approaches and associated tools, which facilitate the implementation of continuous
practices in the following ways: 1) reducing build and test time in continuous integration (CI); 2) increasing
visibility and awareness on build and test results in CI; 3) supporting (semi-) automated continuous testing;
4) detecting violations, flaws, and faults in CI; 5) addressing security and scalability issues in deployment
pipeline; and 6) improving dependability and reliability of deployment process. We have also determined
a list of critical factors, such as testing (effort and time), team awareness and transparency, good design
principles, customer, highly skilled and motivated team, application domain, and appropriate infrastructure
that should be carefully considered when introducing continuous practices in a given organization. The
majority of the reviewed papers were validation (34.7%) and evaluation (36.2%) research types. This paper
also reveals that continuous practices have been successfully applied to both greenfield and maintenance
projects. Continuous practices have become an important area of software engineering research and practice.
While the reported approaches, tools, and practices are addressing a wide range of challenges, there are
several challenges and gaps, which require future research work for improving the capturing and reporting
of contextual information in the studies reporting different aspects of continuous practices; gaining a deep
understanding of how software-intensive systems should be (re-) architected to support continuous practices;
and addressing the lack of knowledge and tools for engineering processes of designing and running secure
deployment pipelines.},

	abstract = {Getting software released to users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process. This groundbreaking new book sets out the principles and technical practices that enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users. Through automation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers, and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours---sometimes even minutes---no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base. Jez Humble and David Farley begin by presenting the foundations of a rapid, reliable, low-risk delivery process. Next, they introduce the deployment pipeline, an automated process for managing all changes, from check-in to release. Finally, they discuss the 'ecosystem' needed to support continuous delivery, from infrastructure, data and configuration management to governance. The authors introduce state-of-the-art techniques, including automated infrastructure management and data migration, and the use of virtualization. For each, they review key issues, identify best practices, and demonstrate how to mitigate risks.},

	abstract = {Software is increasingly crucial to scholarship, yet the visibility and usefulness of software in the scientific record are in question. Just as with data, the visibility of software in publications is related to incentives to share software in reusable ways, and so promote efficient science. In this article, we examine software in publications through content analysis of a random sample of 90 biology articles. We develop a coding scheme to identify software "mentions" and classify them according to their characteristics and ability to realize the functions of citations. Overall, we find diverse and problematic practices: Only between 31% and 43% of mentions involve formal citations; informal mentions are very common, even in high impact factor journals and across different kinds of software. Software is frequently inaccessible 15%-29% of packages in any form; between 90% and 98% of specific versions; only between 24%-40% provide source code. Cites to publications are particularly poor at providing version information, whereas informal mentions are particularly poor at providing crediting information. We provide recommendations to improve the practice of software citation, highlighting recent nascent efforts. Software plays an increasingly great role in scientific practice; it deserves a clear and useful place in scholarly communication.},

	abstract = {Although the goal of scientists is to do science, not to develop software, many scientists have extended their roles to include software development to their skills. However, since scientists have different background, it remains unclear how do they perceive software engineering practices or how do they acquire software engineering knowledge. In this paper we conducted an external replication of one influential 10 years paper about how scientists develop and use scientific software. In particular, we employed the same method (an on-line questionnaire) in a different population (R developers). When analyzing the more than 1,572 responses received, enriched with data gathered from their GitHub repositories, we correlated our findings with the original study. We found that the results were consistent in many ways, including: (1) scientists that develop software work mostly alone, (2) they decide themselves what they want to work on next, and (3) most of what they learnt came from self-study, rather than a formal education. However, we also uncover new facts, such as: some of the ``pain points'' regarding software development are not related to technical activities (e.g., interruptions, lack of collaborators, and lack of a reward system play a role). Our replication can help researchers, practitioners, and educators to better focus their efforts on topics that are important to the scientific community that develops software.},

	annote = {- nice reference on 90-95% of researchers relying on research software
- mention of Carpentries, IRIS-HEP (should look at) and MolSSI (should look at)
- difficult for researchers to find and use research software (Joppa et al, 2013)
- lack of standards and platforms for categorizing software for communities often leads to re-developing instead of reusing solutions (Howison et al, 2015)
- {should look at pain point papers - Pinto et al, 2018 and Wiese et al 2020}

- great review of the literature on studies of scientific software development

- maybe should point out the scientific software is the same thing as research software

- great information on the neglect (and importance) of requirements

- traceability between survey questions and RQs?

- were results different for different disciplines?  they asked the respondents for this information

- future work should look at what the projects actually do, not just what they claim that they do - this is the work that Olu is currently doing

- excellent way to promote Drasil through the Tools support for development activities - less than 30% of respondents reported requirements, design, maintenance and documentation as well-supported

- use of CI can be contrated with the results from Ao's SOP paper

- do the respondents know what the terminology means - requirements, software carpentry, etc.?
- follow up interviews to fully explore, make sure understand?

- future work?

- threats to validity?

- Olu can compare her work to what the results of the surveys say - how many people actually write something that could be called a requirements document?

	abstract = {Scientific discovery increasingly relies on computation through simulations, analytics, and machine and deep learning. Of these, simulations on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms have been the cornerstone of scientific computing for more than two decades. However, the development of simulation software has, in general, occurred through accretion, with a few exceptions. With an increase in scientific understanding, models have become more complex, rendering an accretion mode untenable to the point where software productivity and sustainability have become active concerns in scientific computing. In this survey paper, we examine a modest set of HPC scientific simulation applications that are already using cutting-edge HPC platforms. Several have been in existence for a decade or more. Our objective in this survey is twofold: first, to understand the landscape of scientific computing on HPC platforms in order to distill the currently scattered knowledge about software practices that have helped both developer and software productivity, and second, to understand the kind of tools and methodologies that need attention for continued productivity. },

	abstract = {Research software, which includes both source code and executables used as part of
the research process, presents a significant challenge for efforts aimed at ensuring
reproducibility. In order to inform such efforts, we conducted a survey to better
understand the characteristics of research software as well as how it is created, used,
and shared by researchers. Based on the responses of 215 participants, representing a
range of research disciplines, we found that researchers create, use, and share software
in a wide variety of forms for a wide variety of purposes, including data collection,
data analysis, data visualization, data cleaning and organization, and automation. More
participants indicated that they use open source software than commercial software.
While a relatively small number of programming languages (e.g., Python, R, JavaScript,
C++, MATLAB) are used by a large number, there is a long tail of languages used by
relatively few. Between-group comparisons revealed that significantly more participants
from computer science write source code and create executables than participants from
other disciplines. Differences between researchers from computer science and other
disciplines related to the knowledge of best practices of software creation and sharing
were not statistically significant. While many participants indicated that they draw
a distinction between the sharing and preservation of software, related practices and
perceptions were often not aligned with those of the broader scholarly communications
community.

	annote = {`` Software-related best practices have
been outlined for both individuals working in specific research disciplines (Eglen et al.,
2017; Marwick, 2017) and for the research community in general (e.g., Piccolo & Frampton,
2016; Sandve et al., 2013; Jimenez et al., 2017). In general, such best practice documents
focus on the importance of concepts such as proper documentation and version control
in ensuring that code is shared in a way that facilitates computational reproducibility. In
contrast, the focus of community organizations such as The Carpentries (Wilson, 2006;
Teal et al., 2015) and the Software Sustainability Institute (Crouch et al., 2013) is training
researchers to better develop, use, and maintain software tools. Bridging the perspectives of
stakeholders focused on encouraging best practices in sharing software and those focused
on educating researchers in its creation and use are organizations such as Force11, who
have published guidelines for describing and citing software in the scholarly literature
(Smith, Katz & Niemeyer, 2016).''

	abstract = {Software is now a vital scientific instrument, provid- ing the tools for data collection and analysis across disciplines from bioinformatics and computational physics, to the human- ities. The software used in research is often home-grown and bespoke: it is constructed for a particular project, and rarely maintained beyond this, leading to rapid decay, and frequent `reinvention of the wheel'. Understanding how to develop sus- tainable research software, such that it is suitable for future reuse, is therefore of interest to both researchers and funders, but how to achieve this remains an open question. Here we report the results of an interview study examining how research software engineers -- the people actively developing software in an academic research environment -- subjectively define soft- ware sustainability. Thematic analysis of the data reveals two interacting dimensions: intrinsic sustainability, which relates to internal qualities of software, such as modularity, encapsulation and testability, and extrinsic sustainability, concerning cultural and organisational factors, including how software is resourced, supported and shared. Research software engineers believe an increased focus on quality and discoverability are key factors in increasing the sustainability of academic research software.},

@article{WieseEtAl2019,
	abstract = {The scientific software community is eagerly embracing software development practices and tools. However, the lack of Computer Science background, in general, and Software Engineering training, in particular, pose a toll on scientists that need to develop software. Although some of the problems that scientific software developers face when developing scientific software are already known in the literature, we believe that a comprehensive characterization of this complex landscape is still missing. In this paper we build a taxonomy of 2,110 problems (the so called ``pains'') reported by 1,577 scientific software developers. These problems are grouped into three major axes: technical-related, social-related, and scientific-related problems. Our report helps to better understand the needs and challenges of this so far not fully understood community.},
	annote = {``Technical-related problems are by far the most common problems that our scientific software developers face. As Figure 1 shows, technical-related problems represent more than 70% of the overall set of problems. The percentages represent the share of respondents that mentioned each pain.''

``According to our respondents, ​Software Requirements and Management is the software engineering discipline that most hurts scientific developers (they account for 23% of the technical problems reported).''

``Problems related to the evolution of ​Functional Requirements (e.g., ``​The objective changes after having worked on it for months​'') was cited by many respondents. Moreover, in spite of its importance, we perceived that writing a good ​Documentation also poses a major issue. For instance, one respondent mentioned that ``​I work with biologists that have little knowledge of programming. Therefore, the software must be easy to use. Write a clear documentation is always a challenge​''. ​Documentation issues are 8.7% of the total problems raised by the respondents, considering the technical, social and scientific-related problems group.''

``Scientific developers also face a hard time when conducting ​Software Testing and Debugging activities, which represents more than 14% of the total pains presented. This is particularly relevant due to the intrinsic non-deterministic nature of exploring research questions, as one respondent mentioned: ``​It's frequently difficult to test scientific software, since you might not even know in advance what the answer should be​''.''

``Finally, the ​Other category groups pains associated with, for instance, the lack of programming background (e.g., ``​not having a software development background (i.e.: learning on the fly)​''), the algorithms' performance (e.g., ``​optimizing code that is not running fast enough (pure engineering issue)​''), and the user experience (e.g., ``​anticipating user behavior and designing [a good] user interface​''). Note that, problems regarding ​Programming Background and software ​Performance represent more than 9% of the total problems cited.''},

	annote = {3.5 Documentation

Figure 13 shows the number of respondents who indi- cated they produce certain types of documentation. The most common type of documentation produced by respon- dents was comments in the code, selected by 51 out of 60 respondents. At the other end of the scale, requirements documentation is the least commonly produced type of doc- umentation with only 18 respondents indicating that they commonly produce such artifacts.
The comparative lack of documentation for requirements and design matches the experiences described by Sanders and Kelly [12]. In their study which involved interviewing 16 scientists, `none of [the] interviewees created an up-front formal requirements specification', and `Only one intervie- wee ... demonstrated his design documentation'.

In our survey, 42 out of 60 respondents indicated they commonly produced user manuals and/or guides. However, as seen in Section 3.4, only 25 respondents indicated they often or always produced software for larger groups of up to 100 people and/or an international community of users. Therefore, at least 17 respondents are producing user manu- als and/or guides for themselves or users in their local area. This is at odds with Sanders and Kelly [12], who noted that none of their interviewees `produced user documentation un- less their software was intended for use outside their research group'.

Only three respondents in our survey mentioned docu- mentation being required or compulsory by users or cus- tomers. However, each type of documentation was com- monly produced by around 20 to 40 of the 60 respondents. This contrasts to Segal [15] who identified that professional end user developers (non-software domain specialists who produce software for specific purposes) `did not voluntar- ily produce documentation, apart from the occasional user guide'.

The survey respondents were also asked why documenta- tion is or is not commonly produced for scientific software applications which they have worked on. From the 50 re- sponses to this open-ended question, a range of reasons both for an against the production of documentation were identi- fied using the coding data collection and analysis technique [13].
The most common reasons for and against the production of documentation and their popularity are shown in Figure 14. Note that these these reasons are not mutually exclusive and are not complete. Many respondents provided both rea- sons for and against the production of documentation. Some reasons were only provided by a single respondent and are not included above.},

@book{Fogel2005,
	abstract = {The corporate market is now embracing free, "open source" software like never before, as evidenced by the recent success of the technologies underlying LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). Each is the result of a publicly collaborative process among numerous developers who volunteer their time and energy to create better software. The truth is, however, that the overwhelming majority of free software projects fail. To help you beat the odds, O'Reilly has put together Producing Open Source Software, a guide that recommends tried and true steps to help free software developers work together toward a common goal. Not just for developers who are considering starting their own free software project, this book will also help those who want to participate in the process at any level. The book tackles this very complex topic by distilling it down into easily understandable parts. Starting with the basics of project management, it details specific tools used in free software projects, including version control, IRC, bug tracking, and Wikis. Author Karl Fogel, known for his work on CVS and Subversion, offers practical advice on how to set up and use a range of tools in combination with open mailing lists and archives. He also provides several chapters on the essentials of recruiting and motivating developers, as well as how to gain much-needed publicity for your project. While managing a team of enthusiastic developers -- most of whom you've never even met -- can be challenging, it can also be fun. Producing Open Source Software takes this into account, too, as it speaks of the sheer pleasure to be had from working with a motivated team of free software developers.},

	abstract = {README files play an essential role in shaping a developer's first impression of a software repository and in documenting the software project that the repository hosts. Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the content of a typical README file as well as tools that can process these files automatically. To close this gap, we conduct a qualitative study involving the manual annotation of 4,226 README file sections from 393 randomly sampled GitHub repositories and we design and evaluate a classifier and a set of features that can categorize these sections automatically. We find that information discussing the `What' and `How' of a repository is very common, while many README files lack information regarding the purpose and status of a repository. Our multi-label classifier which can predict eight different categories achieves an F1 score of 0.746. To evaluate the usefulness of the classification, we used the automatically determined classes to label sections in GitHub README files using badges and showed files with and without these badges to twenty software professionals. The majority of participants perceived the automated labeling of sections based on our classifier to ease information discovery. This work enables the owners of software repositories to improve the quality of their documentation and it has the potential to make it easier for the software development community to discover relevant information in GitHub README files.},

	abstract = {We wish to understand the sustainability of current research software development practices. Sustainability is here defined to mean production of software that meets the (explicit and implicit) requirements of the present, while also allowing for cost-effective modifications in the future. To assess current sustainability, we will:
i) analyze existing open source projects to determine what documents, code and scripts are produced;
ii) what concepts are captured by those artifacts;
iii) analyze textbooks and other authoritative sources to determine what documents, code and scripts are recommended;
iv) determine what concepts are supposed to be captured by those artifacts.
We will conduct some case studies on specific domains (such as medical imaging software and Lattice Boltzmann Solvers) via ranking representative software in pair-wise comparisons along multiple quality measures. For the top software thus identified, we will conduct simple experiments to assess usability and modifiability. For the latter, we will ask domain experts to make a small change to the software, and record the time and the details of the process used to make the change. We will then analyze the correlation between modifiability and the concepts captured in project artifacts. Preliminary results suggest a disparity between the suggested documentation and that which is actually produced for a typical research software project.},

Following a brief introduction, the author presents an overview of these types of software. Next comes a discussion of licensing issues unique to freeware and open source software, which leads directly to issues of registration. The author then offers several strategies readers can adopt to locate these software packages on the Web. The author then addresses questions regarding the use of freeware and open source software before offering a few closing thoughts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0in;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&#38;gt;},

	abstract = {Although reproducibility--the idea that a valid scientific experiment can be repeated with similar results--
is integral to our understanding of good scientific practice, it has remained a difficult concept to define
precisely. Across scientific disciplines, the increasing prevalence of large datasets, and the computational
techniques necessary to manage and analyze those datasets, has prompted new ways of thinking about
reproducibility. We present findings from a qualitative study of a NSF--funded two-week workshop developed
to introduce an interdisciplinary group of domain scientists to data-management techniques for data-intensive
computing, with a focus on reproducible science. Our findings suggest that the introduction of data-related
activities promotes a new understanding of reproducibility as a mechanism for local knowledge transfer and
collaboration, particularly as regards efficient software reuse.},

@article{ZOWGHI2003,
	abstract = {The initial expression of requirements for a computer-based system is often informal and possibly vague. Requirements engineers need to examine this often incomplete and inconsistent brief expression of needs. Based on the available knowledge and expertise, assumptions are made and conclusions are deduced to transform this `rough sketch' into more complete, consistent, and hence correct requirements. This paper addresses the question of how to characterize these properties in an evolutionary framework, and what relationships link these properties to a customer's view of correctness. Moreover, we describe in rigorous terms the different kinds of validation checks that must be performed on different parts of a requirements specification in order to ensure that errors (i.e. cases of inconsistency and incompleteness) are detected and marked as such, leading to better quality requirements.},

	abstract = {is study has focused on the technical sustainability dimension of sustainable soware engineering. Sustainabilitywithin soware engineering is something that has recently started to gain traction, where most of theresearch has focused on the environmental dimension.e purpose of this study was to investigate the technicalsustainability dimension, and contribute by continuing to build upon previous research which has suggestedsustainability as a part of non-functional requirements and as a part of soware quality.is study was conducted with a qualitative approach. is approach used interviews with people withexperience of working in soware development to collect data. e interviews were used to gain in-depthinformation of the dierent aspects in soware development, e.g. development processes.e results, based on the interviews, showed that from a technical sustainability perspective there are issueswith where the focus of the work is in soware development and also problems related to how timemanagementis used.e results also showed that there was some lacking in understanding the benets and tradeos ofdecisions made in the project, for example regarding the soware design, which can result in unnecessarycomplexity is acquired.e study found that the culture within soware development projects and companies needs to be changedtowards a culture which promotes the development of high quality soware. Because non-functional requirementsand soware quality are components of technical sustainability, therefore is the technical sustainabilityhigher if the quality is high. It was further found that this culture would be possible if changes were made tothe way prioritisations are made, and the way testing is performed should be extended. Finally it was foundthat the understanding of the benets and tradeos of decisions and ideas needs to be increased and extendedcollectively.e study concluded that the technical sustainability dimension can be achieved through these changes andthat the problem and solution therefore are not small and local but rather a big and complex issue where thesolution spans several solutions that encompasses dierent aspects and perspectives. },

	abstract = {The development of sustainable software has been identified as one of the key challenges in the field of computational science and engineering. However, there is currently no agreed definition of the concept. Current definitions range from a composite, non-functional requirement to simply an emergent property. This lack of clarity leads to confusion, and potentially to ineffective and inefficient efforts to develop sustainable software systems. The aim of this paper is to explore the emerging definitions of software sustainability from the field of software engineering in order to contribute to the question, what is software sustainability? The preliminary analysis suggests that the concept of software sustainability is complex and multifaceted with any consensus towards a shared definition within the field of software engineering yet to be achieved.},

	abstract = {Most of today's decision makers will be dead before the planet suffers the full consequences of acid rain, global warning, ozone depletion, widespread desertification, and species loss. Most of today's young voters, however, will be alive. In this, perhaps the most important document of the decade on the future of the world, the urgency of changing certain policy decisions, some of which threaten the very survival of the human race, is made abundantly clear. The World Commission on Environment and Development, headed by Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of Norway, was set up as an independent body in 1983 by the United Nations. Its brief was to re-examine the critical environment, to develop proposals to solve them, and to ensure that human progress will be sustained through development without bankrupting the resources of future generations. In Our Common Future, the Commission serves notice that the time has come for a marriage of economy and ecology, so that governments and their people can take responsibility not just for environmental damage, but for the policies that cause the damage. It is not too late to change these policies; but, it warns, we must act now.},

	abstract = {Case study is a suitable research methodology for software engineering research since it studies contemporary phenomena in its natural context. However, the understanding of what constitutes a case study varies, and hence the quality of the resulting studies. This paper aims at providing an introduction to case study methodology and guidelines for researchers conducting case studies and readers studying reports of such studies. The content is based on the authors' own experience from conducting and reading case studies. The terminology and guidelines are compiled from different methodology handbooks in other research domains, in particular social science and information systems, and adapted to the needs in software engineering. We present recommended practices for software engineering case studies as well as empirically derived and evaluated checklists for researchers and readers of case study research.},
	annote = {- Case studies do not generate the same results on e.g. causal relationships as controlled experiments do, but they provide deeper understanding of the phenomena under study. 
- case study is an empirical method aimed at investigating contemporary phenomena in their context.  - uses multiple sources of evidence, boundary between the phenomenon and its context may be unclear, information gathering from few entities (people, groups, organizations), lack of experimental control.
- a case study may contain elements of other research methods, e.g. a survey may be conducted within a case study, literature search often precede a case study and archival analyses may be a part of its data collection. Ethnographic methods, like interviews and observations are mostly used for data collection in case studies.
- Action research, with its purpose to ``influence or change some aspect of whatever is the focus of the research'' (Robson 2002), is closely related to case study. More strictly, a case study is purely observational while action research is focused on and involved in the change process. {Research using Drasil seems to be Action research} - when studying the effects of a change, e.g. in pre- and post-event studies, we classify the methodology as case study.

We distinguish between four types of purposes for research based on Robson's (2002) classification:
& Exploratory---finding out what is happening, seeking new insights and generating ideas and hypotheses for new research.
& Descriptive---portraying a situation or phenomenon.
& Explanatory---seeking an explanation of a situation or a problem, mostly but not necessary in the form of a causal relationship.
& Improving---trying to improve a certain aspect of the studied phenomenon. - case studies in software engineering often take an improvement approach, similar to action research

{Research on using Drasil will be of the Exploratory and Improving classifications}

- Case studies are by definition conducted in real world settings, and thus have a high degree of realism, mostly at the expense of the level of control.

Case studies tend mostly to be based on qualitative data, as these provide a richer and deeper description. However, a combination of qualitative and quantitative data often provides better understanding of the studied phenomenon (Seaman 1999), i.e. what is sometimes called ``mixed methods'' (Robson 2002).

The research process may be characterized as fixed or flexible according to Anastas and MacDonald (1994) and Robson (2002). In a fixed design process, all parameters are defined at the launch of the study, while in a flexible design process key parameters of the study may be changed during the course of the study. Case studies are typically flexible design studies, while experiments and surveys are fixed design studies.

Four different types of triangulation may be applied (Stake 1995):
& Data (source) triangulation---using more than one data source or collecting the same data at different occasions.
& Observer triangulation---using more than one observer in the study.
& Methodological triangulation---combining different types of data collection methods,
e.g. qualitative and quantitative methods.
& Theory triangulation---using alternative theories or viewpoints.

{For Drasil NSERC - collect data from different sources, use more than one observer? combine different types of data collection methods, theory triangulation - Drasil versus Epsilon}

Perry et al. define similar criteria for a case study (Perry et al. 2005). It is expected that a case study:
- ``Has research questions set out from the beginning of the study
- Data is collected in a planned and consistent manner
- Inferences are made from the data to answer the research question
- Explores a phenomenon, or produces an explanation, description, or causal analysis of it Threats to validity are addressed in a systematic way.''

- In summary, the key characteristics of a case study are that 1) it is of flexible type, coping with the complex and dynamic characteristics of real world phenomena, like software engineering, 2) its conclusions are based on a clear chain of evidence, whether qualitative or quantitative, collected from multiple sources in a planned and consistent manner, and 3) it adds to existing knowledge by being based on previously established theory, if such exist, or by building theory.

When conducting a case study, there are five major process steps to be walked through:
1. Case study design: objectives are defined and the case study is planned.
2. Preparation for data collection: procedures and protocols for data collection are defined.
3. Collecting evidence: execution with data collection on the studied case.
4. Analysis of collected data
5. Reporting

Definitions:
- The overall objective is a statement of what is expected to be achieved in the case study.
- The objective is refined into a set of research questions, which are to be answered through the case study analysis.
- A case may be based on a software engineering theory.
- A research question may be related to a hypothesis
- A case study protocol defines the detailed procedures for collection and analysis of the raw data, sometimes called field procedures.

A plan for a case study should at least contain the following elements (Robson 2002):
& Objective---what to achieve?
& The case---what is studied?
& Theory---frame of reference
& Research questions---what to know?
& Methods---how to collect data?
& Selection strategy---where to seek data?

- paper published in 2002 - at the time the authors observed that the standard for empirical software engineering resarch was poor
- empirical studies are challenging - medical and phychiatric fields still struggle (citations given to show this)
- would expect different guildelines for different purposes (randomized trials, surveys, exploratory stides, etc.)
- guidelines under six basic topic areas:
	- experimental context
	- experimental design
	- conduct of experiment and data collection
	- analysis
	- presentation of results
	- interpretation of results

2. EXPERIMENTAL CONTEXT

- experimental context has three elements: background information about the industrial circumstances in which am empicral study takes place, discuss the research hypotheses, information about related research
- C1: Be sure to specify as much of the industrial context as possible.  In particular, clearly define the entities, attributes, and measures that are capturing the contextual information
- two types of empirical studies: observational and formal experiments

2.2.1 Observational Studies

- researchers need to identify the particular factors that might ffect the generality and utlility of the conclusions, such as: the industry in which products are made, nature of software dev organization, skills and experience of software staff, type of software products, software process being used
- important not only to identify appropriate contextual variables, but also to measure them consistently - followed by discussion that even lines of code is defined differently by different researchers

2.2.2 Formal Experiments

- make sure that the experiments are not too much of an oversimplification of reality
- make sure to not ignore other measures - for instance, even if the intervention has no effect on performance, it might have an affect on other benefits (example given of inspection techniques)
- C2: If a specific hypothesis is being tested, state it clearly prior to performing the study and discuss the theory from which it is derived, so that its implications are apparent
- avoid shallow hypothesis - relate hyptheses to theory
- C3: If the research is exploratory, state clearly and, prior to data analysis, what questions the investigation is intended to address and how it will address them.
- define research questions in advance
- C4: Describe resarch that is similar to, or has a bearing on, the current research and how current work relates to it.

3 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

- describe the products, resources and processes involved in the study
- D1: Identify the population from which the subjects and objects are drawn.
- D2: Define the process by which the subjects and objects were selected.
- D3: Define the process by which the subjects and objects are assigned to treatments.
	- make the assignment unbiased
	- if use more complex designs, or non-randomized design, include a statistics expert on the team
- D4: Restrict yourself to simply study design, or consult a statistician
- D6: For formal experiments, perform a pre-experiment or precalcuation to identify or estimate the minimum required sample size,
- D7: Use appropriate levels of blinding
	- not always possible, since subjects will know what technique they are using (unlike a patient taking medicine)
- D8: If you cannot avoid evaluationg your own work, then make explicit any vested interests (including your sources of support) and report what  you have done to minimize bias.
- D9: Avoid the use of controls unless you are sure the control situation can be unambiguously defined
	- usually there is no common default technology - cannot really compare ``with'' a technology to ``without'' the technology, because the ``without'' will be different for different groups, organization, companies, individuals.  Can compare two techniques.
- D10: Fully define all treatments (interventions)
- D11: Justify the choice of outcomes measures in terms of their relevance to the objectives of the empirical study

Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 - more detail on statistical measures, quality control, presentation, outliers etc.

	abstract = {We present the design and implementation of a generative geometric kernel. The kernel generator is generic, type-safe, parametrized by many design-level choices and extensible.  The resulting code has minimal traces of the design abstractions.  We achieve genericity through a layered design deriving concepts from affine geometry, linear algebra and abstract algebra.  We achieve parametrization and type-safety by using OCaml's module system, including higher order modules. The cost of abstraction is removed by using MetaOCaml's support for code generation coupled with some annotations atop the code type.},

@article{LucivEtAl2018,
	abstract = {Contemporary software documentation is as complicated as the software itself. During its lifecycle, the documentation accumulates a lot of ``near duplicate'' fragments, i.e. chunks of text that were copied from a single source and were later modified in different ways. Such near duplicates decrease documentation quality and thus hamper its further utilization. At the same time, they are hard to detect manually due to their fuzzy nature. In this paper we give a formal definition of near duplicates and present an algorithm for their detection in software documents. This algorithm is based on the exact software clone detection approach: the software clone detection tool Clone Miner was adapted to detect exact duplicates in documents. Then, our algorithm uses these exact duplicates to construct near ones. We evaluate the proposed algorithm using the documentation of 19 open source and commercial projects. Our evaluation is very comprehensive -- it covers various documentation types: design and requirement specifications, programming guides and API documentation, user manuals. Overall, the evaluation shows that all kinds of software documentation contain a significant number of both exact and near duplicates. Next, we report on the performed manual analysis of the detected near duplicates for the Linux Kernel Documentation. We present both quantative and qualitative results of this analysis, demonstrate algorithm strengths and weaknesses, and discuss the benefits of duplicate management in software documents.},

	abstract = {The use of software is pervasive in all fields of science. Associated software development efforts may be very large, long lived, and complex, requiring the commitment of significant resources. However, several authors have argued that the ``gap'' or ``chasm'' between software engineering and scientific programming is a serious risk to the production of reliable scientific results, as demonstrated in a number of case studies. This article reviews the research that addresses the gap, exploring how both software engineering and research practice may need to evolve to accommodate the use of software in science.},

	abstract = {Large-scale collaborative scientific software projects require more knowledge than any one person typically possesses. This makes coordination and communication of knowledge and expertise a key factor in creating and safeguarding software quality, without which we cannot have sustainable software. However, as researchers attempt to scale up the production of software, they are confronted by problems of awareness and understanding. This presents an opportunity to develop better practices and tools that directly address these challenges. To that end, we conducted a case study of developers of the Trilinos project. We surveyed the software development challenges addressed and show how those problems are connected with what they know and how they communicate. Based on these data, we provide a series of practicable recommendations, and outline a path forward for future research.},
	annote = {- cites Drasil (Dan's position paper) and Thulasi's work (5 redevelopment projects)
- seems like MandR assumed the potential problems - should have provided an opportunity for new problems to emerge from user feedback
- they implied that Drasil cannot capture tacit knowledge that cannot be codefied, likely because they misunderstood Drasil
	- if Drasil is successful, much of the knowledge they are referring to only has to be entered once, the communication is through documentation, mistakes cannot be repeated in the same way as the anecdote in the paper because the code is generated},

Although some computational science projects---those illustrated by figures 1−4, for example---stress all three requirements, many other current and planned projects give them insufficient attention.   In the absence of any one of those requirements, one doesn't have the assurance of independent assessment, confirmation, and repeatability of results. Because it's impossible to judge the validity of such results, they often have little credibility and no impact.''

- more examples of failures - missed discovery

- emphasizes verification and validation},

@article{SmithAndKoothoor2016,
	abstract = {This paper presents a documentation and development method to facilitate the certification of scientific computing software used in the safety analysis of nuclear facilities. To study the problems faced during quality assurance and certification activities, a case study was performed on legacy software used for thermal analysis of a fuelpin in a nuclear reactor. Although no errors were uncovered in the code, 27 issues of incompleteness and inconsistency were found with the documentation. This work proposes that software documentation follow a rational process, which includes a software requirements specification following a template that is reusable, maintainable, and understandable. To develop the design and implementation, this paper suggests literate programming as an alternative to traditional structured programming. Literate programming allows for documenting of numerical algorithms and code together in what is termed the literate programmer's manual. This manual is developed with explicit traceability to the software requirements specification. The traceability between the theory, numerical algorithms, and implementation facilitates achieving completeness and consistency, as well as simplifies the process of verification and the associated certification.},

To break the gridlock, we must establish a degree of cooperation and collaboration with the software engineering community that does not yet exist.},

``we saw many mani- festations of a productivity crisis: frustratingly long and troubled software development times, a growing shortage of expertise in critical areas,5 a dysfunctional market in supporting tools,6 acute problems in achieving required portability (both portable software and portable programming skills), and growing concern about the reliability of scientific results based on that software.''

``When asked about strategies for building con- fidence in their codes, the scientific programmers we studied answered strictly in terms of the sci- ence. Typical responses? That the output ``looked right'' to the domain scientist, and confidence in the code grew over time.''

- say can address productivity gridlock through automation (page 35, bottom) and abstraction - this is the idea behind DSL and generative programming - also says that measurement is important

- did a redevelopment experiment similar to ones done by Smith et al, but seem to have completely ignored documentation, focused on code},
