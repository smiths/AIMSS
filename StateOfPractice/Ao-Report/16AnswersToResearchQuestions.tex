\section{Threats to Validity}

This section lists all the potential threats to the validity of our research.

\begin{enumerate}
\item We compared nine software qualities for 29 software packages, so we could only spend a limited time on each of them. As a result, our assessments may not be thorough in revealing their status fully.
\item We used the grading template in Appendix \ref{ap_grading_template} to guide our measurements. Our impressions of the software - such as user experience - were factors in deciding some scores. Thus, there is a risk that some scores may be subjective and biased.
\item It was not practical to ask each development team for every piece of information. We collected much information - such as artifacts and funding situations of software - by ourselves. There may be cases that we missed some information.
\item We interviewed eight teams, which is a good proportion of the 29. However, there is still a risk that they might not well represent the whole MI software community.
\item As mentioned in Section \ref{ch_interview}, one interviewee was too busy to participate in a full interview, so he provided a version of written answers to us. Since we did not have the chance to explain our questions or ask him follow-up questions, there is a possibility of misinterpretation of the questions or answers.
\end{enumerate}
