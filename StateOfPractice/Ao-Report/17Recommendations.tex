\section{Recommendations to Software Qualities}

We list some of the key points that may improve each quality as follows,
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Installability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item clear instructions;
    \item automated installer;
    \item including all dependencies in the installer;
    \item avoiding heavily depending on other commercial products (e.g. Matlab);
    \item considering building a web application that needs no installation.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Correctness \& Verifiability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item test-driven development with unit tests, integration tests, nightly tests, etc.
    \item two stage development process with stable release \& nightly builds;
    \item CI/CD;
    \item documents of requirements specifications and theory manuals.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reliability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item test-driven development with unit tests, integration tests, nightly tests, etc.
    \item two stage development process with stable release \& nightly builds;
    \item descriptive error messages.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Robustness}
\begin{itemize}
    \item designing with exceptions and make the software failures elegant;
    \item descriptive error messages.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Usability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item usability tests and interviews with end users;
    \item adjusting according to users’ feedbacks;
    \item getting started tutorials;
    \item user manuals;
    \item professional UX designs;
    \item active supports to users.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Maintainability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item using GitHub;
    \item modular approach;
    \item documentation for developers, such as project plan, developer’s manual, and API documentation.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reusability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item modular approach;
    \item API documentation.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Understandability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item modular approach;
    \item consistent codding style;
    \item clear comments;
    \item description of used algorithms;
    \item documentation;
    \item communication between developers and users via GitHub issues, mailing lists, forums etc.
    \item graphical user interface.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Visibility/Transparency}
\begin{itemize}
    \item documents for the development process, project status, development environment, and release notes.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reproducibility}
\begin{itemize}
    \item test-driven development with unit tests, integration tests, nightly tests, etc.
    \item open-source;
    \item making data and documentation available;
    \item using open-source libraries.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
