@article{FeinbergEtAl2020,
	abstract = {Although reproducibility--the idea that a valid scientific experiment can be repeated with similar results--
is integral to our understanding of good scientific practice, it has remained a difficult concept to define
precisely. Across scientific disciplines, the increasing prevalence of large datasets, and the computational
techniques necessary to manage and analyze those datasets, has prompted new ways of thinking about
reproducibility. We present findings from a qualitative study of a NSF--funded two-week workshop developed
to introduce an interdisciplinary group of domain scientists to data-management techniques for data-intensive
computing, with a focus on reproducible science. Our findings suggest that the introduction of data-related
activities promotes a new understanding of reproducibility as a mechanism for local knowledge transfer and
collaboration, particularly as regards efficient software reuse.},

	abstract = {The initial expression of requirements for a computer-based system is often informal and possibly vague. Requirements engineers need to examine this often incomplete and inconsistent brief expression of needs. Based on the available knowledge and expertise, assumptions are made and conclusions are deduced to transform this `rough sketch' into more complete, consistent, and hence correct requirements. This paper addresses the question of how to characterize these properties in an evolutionary framework, and what relationships link these properties to a customer's view of correctness. Moreover, we describe in rigorous terms the different kinds of validation checks that must be performed on different parts of a requirements specification in order to ensure that errors (i.e. cases of inconsistency and incompleteness) are detected and marked as such, leading to better quality requirements.},

Sustainabilitywithin soware engineering is something that has recently started to gain traction, where most of theresearch has focused on the environmental dimension.e purpose of this study was to investigate the technicalsustainability dimension, and contribute by continuing to build upon previous research which has suggestedsustainability as a part of non-functional requirements and as a part of soware quality.is study was conducted with a qualitative approach. is approach used interviews with people withexperience of working in soware development to collect data. e interviews were used to gain in-depthinformation of the dierent aspects in soware development, e.g. development processes.e results, based on the interviews, showed that from a technical sustainability perspective there are issueswith where the focus of the work is in soware development and also problems related to how timemanagementis used.e results also showed that there was some lacking in understanding the benets and tradeos ofdecisions made in the project, for example regarding the soware design, which can result in unnecessarycomplexity is acquired.e study found that the culture within soware development projects and companies needs to be changedtowards a culture which promotes the development of high quality soware. Because non-functional requirementsand soware quality are components of technical sustainability, therefore is the technical sustainabilityhigher if the quality is high. It was further found that this culture would be possible if changes were made tothe way prioritisations are made, and the way testing is performed should be extended. Finally it was foundthat the understanding of the benets and tradeos of decisions and ideas needs to be increased and extendedcollectively.e study concluded that the technical sustainability dimension can be achieved through these changes andthat the problem and solution therefore are not small and local but rather a big and complex issue where thesolution spans several solutions that encompasses dierent aspects and perspectives. },

However, there is currently no agreed definition of the concept. Current definitions range from a composite, non-functional requirement to simply an emergent property. This lack of clarity leads to confusion, and potentially to ineffective and inefficient efforts to develop sustainable software systems. The aim of this paper is to explore the emerging definitions of software sustainability from the field of software engineering in order to contribute to the question, what is software sustainability? The preliminary analysis suggests that the concept of software sustainability is complex and multifaceted with any consensus towards a shared definition within the field of software engineering yet to be achieved.},

Most of today's young voters, however, will be alive. In this, perhaps the most important document of the decade on the future of the world, the urgency of changing certain policy decisions, some of which threaten the very survival of the human race, is made abundantly clear. The World Commission on Environment and Development, headed by Gro Harlem Brundtland, Prime Minister of Norway, was set up as an independent body in 1983 by the United Nations. Its brief was to re-examine the critical environment, to develop proposals to solve them, and to ensure that human progress will be sustained through development without bankrupting the resources of future generations. In Our Common Future, the Commission serves notice that the time has come for a marriage of economy and ecology, so that governments and their people can take responsibility not just for environmental damage, but for the policies that cause the damage. It is not too late to change these policies; but, it warns, we must act now.},

	abstract = {Case study is a suitable research methodology for software engineering research since it studies contemporary phenomena in its natural context. However, the understanding of what constitutes a case study varies, and hence the quality of the resulting studies. This paper aims at providing an introduction to case study methodology and guidelines for researchers conducting case studies and readers studying reports of such studies. The content is based on the authors' own experience from conducting and reading case studies. The terminology and guidelines are compiled from different methodology handbooks in other research domains, in particular social science and information systems, and adapted to the needs in software engineering. We present recommended practices for software engineering case studies as well as empirically derived and evaluated checklists for researchers and readers of case study research.},
	annote = {- Case studies do not generate the same results on e.g. causal relationships as controlled experiments do, but they provide deeper understanding of the phenomena under study. 
- case study is an empirical method aimed at investigating contemporary phenomena in their context.  - uses multiple sources of evidence, boundary between the phenomenon and its context may be unclear, information gathering from few entities (people, groups, organizations), lack of experimental control.
- a case study may contain elements of other research methods, e.g. a survey may be conducted within a case study, literature search often precede a case study and archival analyses may be a part of its data collection. Ethnographic methods, like interviews and observations are mostly used for data collection in case studies.
- Action research, with its purpose to ``influence or change some aspect of whatever is the focus of the research'' (Robson 2002), is closely related to case study. More strictly, a case study is purely observational while action research is focused on and involved in the change process. {Research using Drasil seems to be Action research} - when studying the effects of a change, e.g. in pre- and post-event studies, we classify the methodology as case study.

We distinguish between four types of purposes for research based on Robson's (2002) classification:
& Exploratory---finding out what is happening, seeking new insights and generating ideas and hypotheses for new research.
& Descriptive---portraying a situation or phenomenon.
& Explanatory---seeking an explanation of a situation or a problem, mostly but not necessary in the form of a causal relationship.
& Improving---trying to improve a certain aspect of the studied phenomenon. - case studies in software engineering often take an improvement approach, similar to action research

{Research on using Drasil will be of the Exploratory and Improving classifications}

- Case studies are by definition conducted in real world settings, and thus have a high degree of realism, mostly at the expense of the level of control.

Case studies tend mostly to be based on qualitative data, as these provide a richer and deeper description. However, a combination of qualitative and quantitative data often provides better understanding of the studied phenomenon (Seaman 1999), i.e. what is sometimes called ``mixed methods'' (Robson 2002).

The research process may be characterized as fixed or flexible according to Anastas and MacDonald (1994) and Robson (2002). In a fixed design process, all parameters are defined at the launch of the study, while in a flexible design process key parameters of the study may be changed during the course of the study. Case studies are typically flexible design studies, while experiments and surveys are fixed design studies.

Four different types of triangulation may be applied (Stake 1995):
& Data (source) triangulation---using more than one data source or collecting the same data at different occasions.
& Observer triangulation---using more than one observer in the study.
& Methodological triangulation---combining different types of data collection methods,
e.g. qualitative and quantitative methods.
& Theory triangulation---using alternative theories or viewpoints.

{For Drasil NSERC - collect data from different sources, use more than one observer? combine different types of data collection methods, theory triangulation - Drasil versus Epsilon}

Perry et al. define similar criteria for a case study (Perry et al. 2005). It is expected that a case study:
- ``Has research questions set out from the beginning of the study
- Data is collected in a planned and consistent manner
- Inferences are made from the data to answer the research question
- Explores a phenomenon, or produces an explanation, description, or causal analysis of it Threats to validity are addressed in a systematic way.''

- In summary, the key characteristics of a case study are that 1) it is of flexible type, coping with the complex and dynamic characteristics of real world phenomena, like software engineering, 2) its conclusions are based on a clear chain of evidence, whether qualitative or quantitative, collected from multiple sources in a planned and consistent manner, and 3) it adds to existing knowledge by being based on previously established theory, if such exist, or by building theory.

When conducting a case study, there are five major process steps to be walked through:
1. Case study design: objectives are defined and the case study is planned.
2. Preparation for data collection: procedures and protocols for data collection are defined.
3. Collecting evidence: execution with data collection on the studied case.
4. Analysis of collected data
5. Reporting

Definitions:
- The overall objective is a statement of what is expected to be achieved in the case study.
- The objective is refined into a set of research questions, which are to be answered through the case study analysis.
- A case may be based on a software engineering theory.
- A research question may be related to a hypothesis
- A case study protocol defines the detailed procedures for collection and analysis of the raw data, sometimes called field procedures.

A plan for a case study should at least contain the following elements (Robson 2002):
& Objective---what to achieve?
& The case---what is studied?
& Theory---frame of reference
& Research questions---what to know?
& Methods---how to collect data?
& Selection strategy---where to seek data?

	annote = {1. INTRODUCTION

- paper published in 2002 - at the time the authors observed that the standard for empirical software engineering resarch was poor
- empirical studies are challenging - medical and phychiatric fields still struggle (citations given to show this)
- would expect different guildelines for different purposes (randomized trials, surveys, exploratory stides, etc.)
- guidelines under six basic topic areas:
	- experimental context
	- experimental design
	- conduct of experiment and data collection
	- analysis
	- presentation of results
	- interpretation of results

2. EXPERIMENTAL CONTEXT

- experimental context has three elements: background information about the industrial circumstances in which am empicral study takes place, discuss the research hypotheses, information about related research
- C1: Be sure to specify as much of the industrial context as possible.  In particular, clearly define the entities, attributes, and measures that are capturing the contextual information
- two types of empirical studies: observational and formal experiments

2.2.1 Observational Studies

- researchers need to identify the particular factors that might ffect the generality and utlility of the conclusions, such as: the industry in which products are made, nature of software dev organization, skills and experience of software staff, type of software products, software process being used
- important not only to identify appropriate contextual variables, but also to measure them consistently - followed by discussion that even lines of code is defined differently by different researchers

2.2.2 Formal Experiments

- make sure that the experiments are not too much of an oversimplification of reality
- make sure to not ignore other measures - for instance, even if the intervention has no effect on performance, it might have an affect on other benefits (example given of inspection techniques)
- C2: If a specific hypothesis is being tested, state it clearly prior to performing the study and discuss the theory from which it is derived, so that its implications are apparent
- avoid shallow hypothesis - relate hyptheses to theory
- C3: If the research is exploratory, state clearly and, prior to data analysis, what questions the investigation is intended to address and how it will address them.
- define research questions in advance
- C4: Describe resarch that is similar to, or has a bearing on, the current research and how current work relates to it.

3 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

- describe the products, resources and processes involved in the study
- D1: Identify the population from which the subjects and objects are drawn.
- D2: Define the process by which the subjects and objects were selected.
- D3: Define the process by which the subjects and objects are assigned to treatments.
	- make the assignment unbiased
	- if use more complex designs, or non-randomized design, include a statistics expert on the team
- D4: Restrict yourself to simply study design, or consult a statistician
- D6: For formal experiments, perform a pre-experiment or precalcuation to identify or estimate the minimum required sample size,
- D7: Use appropriate levels of blinding
	- not always possible, since subjects will know what technique they are using (unlike a patient taking medicine)
- D8: If you cannot avoid evaluationg your own work, then make explicit any vested interests (including your sources of support) and report what  you have done to minimize bias.
- D9: Avoid the use of controls unless you are sure the control situation can be unambiguously defined
	- usually there is no common default technology - cannot really compare ``with'' a technology to ``without'' the technology, because the ``without'' will be different for different groups, organization, companies, individuals.  Can compare two techniques.
- D10: Fully define all treatments (interventions)
- D11: Justify the choice of outcomes measures in terms of their relevance to the objectives of the empirical study

Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 - more detail on statistical measures, quality control, presentation, outliers etc.

	abstract = {We present the design and implementation of a generative geometric kernel. The kernel generator is generic, type-safe, parametrized by many design-level choices and extensible.  The resulting code has minimal traces of the design abstractions.  We achieve genericity through a layered design deriving concepts from affine geometry, linear algebra and abstract algebra.  We achieve parametrization and type-safety by using OCaml's module system, including higher order modules. The cost of abstraction is removed by using MetaOCaml's support for code generation coupled with some annotations atop the code type.},

@article{LucivEtAl2018,
	abstract = {Contemporary software documentation is as complicated as the software itself. During its lifecycle, the documentation accumulates a lot of ``near duplicate'' fragments, i.e. chunks of text that were copied from a single source and were later modified in different ways. Such near duplicates decrease documentation quality and thus hamper its further utilization. At the same time, they are hard to detect manually due to their fuzzy nature. In this paper we give a formal definition of near duplicates and present an algorithm for their detection in software documents. This algorithm is based on the exact software clone detection approach: the software clone detection tool Clone Miner was adapted to detect exact duplicates in documents. Then, our algorithm uses these exact duplicates to construct near ones. We evaluate the proposed algorithm using the documentation of 19 open source and commercial projects. Our evaluation is very comprehensive -- it covers various documentation types: design and requirement specifications, programming guides and API documentation, user manuals. Overall, the evaluation shows that all kinds of software documentation contain a significant number of both exact and near duplicates. Next, we report on the performed manual analysis of the detected near duplicates for the Linux Kernel Documentation. We present both quantative and qualitative results of this analysis, demonstrate algorithm strengths and weaknesses, and discuss the benefits of duplicate management in software documents.},

Associated software development efforts may be very large, long lived, and complex, requiring the commitment of significant resources. However, several authors have argued that the ``gap'' or ``chasm'' between software engineering and scientific programming is a serious risk to the production of reliable scientific results, as demonstrated in a number of case studies. This article reviews the research that addresses the gap, exploring how both software engineering and research practice may need to evolve to accommodate the use of software in science.},

	abstract = {Large-scale collaborative scientific software projects require more knowledge than any one person typically possesses. This makes coordination and communication of knowledge and expertise a key factor in creating and safeguarding software quality, without which we cannot have sustainable software. However, as researchers attempt to scale up the production of software, they are confronted by problems of awareness and understanding. This presents an opportunity to develop better practices and tools that directly address these challenges. To that end, we conducted a case study of developers of the Trilinos project. We surveyed the software development challenges addressed and show how those problems are connected with what they know and how they communicate. Based on these data, we provide a series of practicable recommendations, and outline a path forward for future research.},
	annote = {- cites Drasil (Dan's position paper) and Thulasi's work (5 redevelopment projects)
- seems like MandR assumed the potential problems - should have provided an opportunity for new problems to emerge from user feedback
- they implied that Drasil cannot capture tacit knowledge that cannot be codefied, likely because they misunderstood Drasil
	- if Drasil is successful, much of the knowledge they are referring to only has to be entered once, the communication is through documentation, mistakes cannot be repeated in the same way as the anecdote in the paper because the code is generated},

Although some computational science projects---those illustrated by figures 1−4, for example---stress all three requirements, many other current and planned projects give them insufficient attention.   In the absence of any one of those requirements, one doesn't have the assurance of independent assessment, confirmation, and repeatability of results. Because it's impossible to judge the validity of such results, they often have little credibility and no impact.''

	abstract = {This paper presents a documentation and development method to facilitate the certification of scientific computing software used in the safety analysis of nuclear facilities. To study the problems faced during quality assurance and certification activities, a case study was performed on legacy software used for thermal analysis of a fuelpin in a nuclear reactor. Although no errors were uncovered in the code, 27 issues of incompleteness and inconsistency were found with the documentation. This work proposes that software documentation follow a rational process, which includes a software requirements specification following a template that is reusable, maintainable, and understandable. To develop the design and implementation, this paper suggests literate programming as an alternative to traditional structured programming. Literate programming allows for documenting of numerical algorithms and code together in what is termed the literate programmer's manual. This manual is developed with explicit traceability to the software requirements specification. The traceability between the theory, numerical algorithms, and implementation facilitates achieving completeness and consistency, as well as simplifies the process of verification and the associated certification.},

To break the gridlock, we must establish a degree of cooperation and collaboration with the software engineering community that does not yet exist.},
	annote = {``The development environment's unique goals and constraints have led the scien- tific programming community to evolve its own characteristic software development approach. As our workflow studies show, this approach cre- ates bottlenecks{\ldots}''

``we saw many mani- festations of a productivity crisis: frustratingly long and troubled software development times, a growing shortage of expertise in critical areas,5 a dysfunctional market in supporting tools,6 acute problems in achieving required portability (both portable software and portable programming skills), and growing concern about the reliability of scientific results based on that software.''

``When asked about strategies for building con- fidence in their codes, the scientific programmers we studied answered strictly in terms of the sci- ence. Typical responses? That the output ``looked right'' to the domain scientist, and confidence in the code grew over time.''

- say can address productivity gridlock through automation (page 35, bottom) and abstraction - this is the idea behind DSL and generative programming - also says that measurement is important

- did a redevelopment experiment similar to ones done by Smith et al, but seem to have completely ignored documentation, focused on code},
